# Chapter 3: The Helbig Family

## Origins in Europe

The Helbig family lived in Dresden, Saxony—one of Germany’s most celebrated cultural capitals. Known as the “Florence on the Elbe,” Dresden was renowned for its art, architecture, and intellectual life. But beneath its grand facade, the city was also an emerging industrial center. In the late 19th century, the artisan trades—including baking, printing, and metalwork—flourished alongside factories and rail depots.

Robert “Traugott Wilhelm” Helbig was born in Dresden in 1852. He trained as a baker, one of the city’s most respected trades. Life in Dresden offered opportunity but also constraints for working-class families, including rigid social hierarchies and mandatory military service. By 1881, Robert decided to emigrate to the United States with his wife Pauline Metzelt and their two daughters.

## Emigration to America

Robert arrived in the U.S. in 1881 and settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico—a surprising destination for a Saxon baker. He worked as the industrial teacher and baker at the Albuquerque Indian School. His wife, Pauline, served as the cook. They played an important role in one of the federal government’s most ambitious—and controversial—assimilation projects aimed at Native American youth.

Tragedy struck early: both of Robert’s daughters died, and Pauline passed away sometime before 1900. Robert later remarried Emma Reitz, under the condition—recorded in church documents—that any children would be raised Catholic, and his existing children could continue practicing their Catholic faith.

## Life on the American Frontier

Robert Helbig’s life in the American West was marked by resilience and misfortune. He was injured multiple times, including being gored by a bull and stabbed in a logging camp fight. A fire destroyed his home in Santa Fe in 1900, and another fire later took his home in Liberty Township, Minnesota.

Despite these hardships, Robert remained a vital part of each community he joined. He worked in logging camps, as a cook, and helped build roads and infrastructure in Liberty Township. He was even part of a local house-moving crew—at one point falling into a creek during the job but returning to work undeterred.

His daughter Gertrude Helbig, born in 1884 in New Mexico, was raised in a multilingual, bicultural household. At age 19, she married John Petri of Minnesota in what the family recalls as a mail-order arrangement. After John’s death in 1913, she remarried Jack Erickson, then later John’s brother, Champy Petri. Gertrude lived to be 99 years old, remembered as small in stature but strong in character.

Robert Helbig died on December 17, 1937, in Liberty Township at the home of his daughter Maria Klasen. He was buried in Bemidji. In his final year, he was cared for by his granddaughter Clara, who, at age 13, changed his bandages and brought him meals.
