📘 Part II – Migration to America

First Settlements: From Port to Prairie

The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a tidal wave of migration to the United States. For families arriving from Europe, the crossing was only the beginning. Once past the gauntlet of immigration checkpoints like Castle Garden or Ellis Island, newcomers dispersed across a vast continent, seeking land, community, or simply a place to survive.

This chapter explores where your ancestors first planted their roots in America—before the long trek west. Each family found a foothold in a region shaped by its own blend of language, opportunity, and hardship. These early settlements became the staging grounds for future generations.

Ports of Entry: Castle Garden, Ellis Island, and Beyond

Before Ellis Island opened in 1892, most immigrants passed through Castle Garden, an immigration station at the tip of Manhattan. After 1892, Ellis Island processed the bulk of arrivals, though some still entered via the Barge Office, or through ports in Baltimore, Philadelphia, New Orleans, or Boston.

At these sites, immigrants were subjected to medical inspections, questioned about their origin, destination, and finances, and sometimes delayed—or denied—entry. Those who passed were tagged and routed to trains headed westward.

Your family’s names appear in these records: sometimes carefully spelled, sometimes phonetically captured by officials unfamiliar with German, Czech, or Luxembourgish accents. From there, rail lines carried them into the interior: to the prairie towns of Kansas and Iowa, the mining frontiers of Minnesota, the arid Southwest, or the crowded row houses of Philadelphia.

Avon and Liberty Township, Minnesota – The Petri Family

When sixteen-year-old John Petri arrived in the United States around 1891, he likely entered through Castle Garden or the Barge Office, part of the final waves of pre-Ellis Island immigrants. He came from the iron-mining town of Rumelange, Luxembourg, and followed migration routes that brought many German-speaking Europeans to Stearns County, Minnesota.

John first lived in Avon, a township in a region dominated by German Catholics. Avon was part of a well-established settlement pattern that included Benedictine monasteries, German parishes, and rich farmland bordered by hardwood forests.

Eventually, John migrated north to Liberty Township in Beltrami County, then still a rugged frontier. There, he worked as a logger and homesteader. Liberty Township was a place of sawmills, immigrant cabins, and newly cut trails winding through the pines. John’s presence helped lay the civic foundation of the area—he served as Justice of the Peace and U.S. Postmaster, rare accomplishments for a first-generation immigrant.

He married Gertrude Helbig, herself from New Mexico, and together they raised five children on a small homestead near Bemidji. His life was tragically cut short in a logging accident, but the community he helped establish endured.

Hanover, Kansas – The Daubel Family

In 1885, Ludwig Daubel, a blacksmith from Bonfeld, Württemberg, brought his family to Hanover, a rural German farming community in Washington County, Kansas. They likely entered via Castle Garden, joining a region settled by German-speaking immigrants from both the Catholic south and Lutheran north of Germany.

Hanover was well-suited for settlers like Ludwig. The town hosted German-language churches and schools, and neighbors often hailed from the same villages back home. Farmers grew wheat and corn, raised hogs and chickens, and relied on tight-knit community life to survive droughts and market swings.

Ludwig set up his forge and worked the land alongside his sons. The Daubel boys—Henry, Phillip, August, Louie, and Charles—grew up in this prairie landscape. Yet by the 1890s, with Kansas becoming increasingly crowded, the sons looked west for new land. Hanover had been a haven, but the Pacific Northwest beckoned.

Iowa – The Bartosh and Reha Families

Frank Bartosh, born in Neznašov, Bohemia, arrived in Iowa in 1865 as an infant. The family joined a vast Czech-speaking enclave that had formed in northeastern Iowa and along the Cedar River Valley. Towns like Spillville, Cresco, and Protivin became centers of Czech-American life, with strong ties to Catholic parishes, community halls, and Bohemian customs.

Frank came of age in this setting, immersed in the rhythms of prairie farming and Czech culture. He married Mary Reha, also of Bohemian descent, in 1887. Together, they raised eight children on a farm in the region.

Czech communities in Iowa prized education, music, and mutual aid societies. Farmers were hardworking, thrifty, and culturally proud—retaining the Czech language well into the 20th century. Frank and Mary were part of this tradition, farming corn, wheat, and hay while attending Mass and participating in local festivals.

In 1911, as land became more expensive and their children reached adulthood, the Bartosh family would leave Iowa for a new beginning in North Dakota. But Iowa was the cradle of their American story.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – The Rudolph Family

Jacob Rudolph arrived from Bempflingen, Württemberg, and settled in Philadelphia in the 1890s. As one of America’s most ethnically diverse and industrial cities, Philadelphia had a thriving German immigrant community, complete with Lutheran churches, singing societies, and German-language newspapers.

Jacob likely worked in one of the city’s many factories or skilled trades. Housing was dense but affordable; immigrants rented floors in brick row houses and walked to work in the leather shops, breweries, or ironworks.

Jacob’s daughter, Marie Rudolph, grew up in this urban landscape—surrounded by both opportunity and hardship. The Rudolphs were part of a German-speaking urban middle class that blended Old World customs with American pragmatism.

Though their life in Philadelphia was stable, Marie eventually chose a very different path—marrying Charles Daubel and moving west to the farm country of northeastern Washington. But her roots lay in Philadelphia’s working neighborhoods, where Jacob had carved out a life with quiet determination.

Santa Fe, New Mexico – The Helbig Family

Robert Helbig, born in Dresden, arrived in America in 1881 and made his way to Santa Fe, New Mexico—an unusual but not unheard-of destination for a German immigrant. Santa Fe was a unique blend of Hispanic, Native American, and Anglo cultures, with adobe buildings and desert winds replacing the stone alleys of Saxony.

Robert worked as a baker and later as a vocational instructor at the Albuquerque Indian School, where he taught cooking and industrial skills to Native American students as part of the federal assimilation program. His first wife and daughters died young, and he remarried a woman named Emma Rights, under the condition that their children be raised Catholic.

Their daughter, Gertrude Helbig, was born in this diverse and dynamic region—a place where German, Spanish, and Native worlds collided. Later in life, Gertrude would leave New Mexico to marry John Petri in Minnesota. But she carried with her the culture and strength of a life formed in the Southwest.

Defiance, Ohio – The Spence Family

The Spence family, originally from Pontefract, Yorkshire, settled in Defiance, Ohio, sometime in the mid-19th century. Defiance, located at the confluence of the Maumee and Auglaize Rivers, was a frontier town that had grown into a small city by the time John W. Spence established his home there.

The town had a strong British and Irish immigrant presence and functioned as a local center of trade and agriculture. Railroads and canals brought in goods, and the surrounding land was being rapidly developed for farming.

The Spences lived among other English-speaking families who had moved west from the Atlantic seaboard. They were part of the slow inland march of Anglo-American settlers who sought land ownership and local civic participation. It was here that John W. Spence raised his children—including Josephine Spence, whose path would one day carry her west to Washington State.
