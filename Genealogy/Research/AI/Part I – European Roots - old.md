📘 Part I – European Roots

Chapter 1: The Petri Family of Rumelange, Luxembourg

Nestled in the iron-rich hills of southern Luxembourg lies the small town of Rumelange, a community shaped by the industrial revolutions of the 19th century. Once a quiet agrarian village, Rumelange found new purpose with the rise of iron mining and steel production—industries that would draw laborers from across the region and define a generation. Among the families rooted in this emerging working-class town was the Petri family, whose legacy would stretch across oceans to the forests of northern Minnesota.

John Petri (born August 24, 1875) entered the world in this rugged landscape, just as Luxembourg was undergoing a transformation from pastoral to industrial. The expansion of the railway and the boom in iron mining brought economic opportunity, but also instability. For many young Luxembourgers, including John, the promise of land and liberty in the New World held greater allure than the soot-filled valleys of southern Europe.

In 1891, at the age of 16, John made the fateful decision to emigrate to the United States. Like many of his countrymen, he may have traveled by train to a northern European port—possibly Antwerp or Le Havre—then boarded a crowded steamship bound for America. He arrived during a peak wave of immigration, when millions were passing through ports like New York’s Castle Garden or the newly opened Ellis Island, seeking new beginnings.

John’s early years in America are lost to time, but we know that by the early 1900s he had made his way to the dense forests of northern Minnesota. There, in Liberty Township near Bemidji, he built a life as a logger, farmer, and public servant. He married Gertrude Helbig, a mail-order bride from Santa Fe, New Mexico, whose own family had crossed continents. Together they raised five children: Mathias, Robert, Fred, John Jr., and Marie. John took on community leadership roles, serving as Justice of the Peace and later as U.S. Postmaster—a sign of his integration into the civic fabric of frontier life.

Tragically, John’s life was cut short at the age of 38 in a logging accident. Yet the family he and Gertrude founded endured and prospered, passing on their values of resilience, faith, and community service. His descendants would carry the Petri name (later spelled “Petrie”) across the country, from the logging camps of Minnesota to the cities of the American West.

Back in Luxembourg, Rumelange continued to grow through the 20th century, eventually becoming home to the National Mining Museum. Today, the town remembers its industrial heritage and the families who gave it life. For the Petris, Rumelange was the beginning of a journey that would lead far beyond its borders—but the memory of those iron hills and the determination forged in them remains part of the family’s enduring legacy.

Chapter 2: The Daubel Family of Bonfeld, Württemberg, Germany

The Daubel family story begins in Bonfeld, a small rural village nestled in the rolling hills of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Situated near the Neckar River, between the cities of Heilbronn and Heidelberg, Bonfeld had been part of the Kingdom of Württemberg—a region known for its vineyards, tight-knit Lutheran communities, and the quiet dignity of life shaped by the rhythms of the land.

Ludwig Daubel, born in 1839, was a blacksmith in Bonfeld during a time of growing tension and transition. Like many German families in the mid-19th century, the Daubels were shaped by the currents of military conscription, economic limitation, and religious rigidity. Germany had not yet unified into a single nation, and the many kingdoms and principalities, including Württemberg, were marked by strict social hierarchies and compulsory military service—realities that weighed heavily on working-class families with sons.

Ludwig was a skilled tradesman, respected in the community, and reasonably prosperous. He had amassed 3,000 marks—equivalent to roughly $20,000 today. But his wealth did not outweigh his concern for the future of his children. Faced with the looming requirement that his sons serve in the military of the Württemberg kingdom, Ludwig made a life-altering decision: he would emigrate with his family to America in pursuit of liberty and opportunity.

Emigration was no simple matter. It required official permission from the local government, and Ludwig’s application to leave is still preserved in archival records. The Royal Württemberg Government issued a certificate of discharge on behalf of Ludwig Daubel and his family, officially releasing them from citizenship and military obligation.

The Daubels arrived in America in 1885, settling first in Washington County, Kansas, near the town of Hanover. This area had become a hub for German-speaking immigrants from various regions—Württemberg, Prussia, Bavaria, and Austria—who brought their language, customs, and Lutheran faith with them. There, Ludwig and his wife began to rebuild their lives on the prairie, but they would not remain in Kansas forever.

As land became scarce in the Midwest and word spread of opportunities in the newly developing timberlands of the Pacific Northwest, Ludwig’s sons—Henry, Phillip, August, Louie, and Charles—ventured westward. They acquired farmland near Elk, Washington, taking advantage of land made available by railroad companies eager to attract settlers. These young men established a foothold in the wilderness, clearing trees, building homes, and planting orchards. Eventually, Ludwig and the rest of the family followed, creating a new Daubel homestead in the shadow of the Cascades.

Though Bonfeld remains a tranquil village today, known for its historic churches and half-timbered houses, it also holds the echoes of a family that once called it home. The blacksmith shop is gone, but the legacy of hard work and bold decisions remains. For Ludwig Daubel and his descendants, Bonfeld was the forge from which they were shaped—strong, steadfast, and ready to meet the frontier with iron resolve.

Chapter 3: The Helbig Family of Dresden, Saxony

Dresden, the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony, has long been renowned for its artistic grandeur, baroque architecture, and intellectual spirit. Yet behind the ornate facades and cultural acclaim, the city was also home to countless working families who supported its vibrant growth through skilled trades and practical labor. Among them was the Helbig family, whose journey would ultimately stretch from the cobbled streets of Saxony to the frontier settlements of the American West.

Robert Helbig was born in Dresden in 1852, during a time of political volatility and social transformation. In the wake of the failed revolutions of 1848 and the increasing consolidation of German states, Saxony’s urban centers were becoming hubs of both cultural sophistication and economic hardship. Tradesmen like Robert were part of the backbone of the city—providing services that kept the growing urban population fed, clothed, and housed.

Robert trained as a baker, a highly respected craft in German cities where fresh bread was a daily staple and guilds regulated the quality of goods. Yet by the late 19th century, economic pressures, overcrowding, and limited opportunities for advancement led many Saxons to look beyond the borders of the German Empire. In 1881, Robert joined the ranks of millions of Europeans leaving for the United States, seeking not only economic stability but also freedom from the increasingly rigid structures of the Old World.

He arrived in America and settled in the Southwest—far from the industrial east coast where many German immigrants congregated. Robert made his way to Santa Fe, New Mexico, a historic crossroads of Spanish, Native American, and Anglo-American cultures. There he found work as a baker and later served as an industrial teacher at the Albuquerque Indian School. The school, part of a federal effort to assimilate Native American children, employed a diverse staff, including tradespeople like Robert who taught practical skills such as cooking, carpentry, and agriculture.

Robert’s first wife, Pauline, and their two daughters, were born in Germany and tragically died before 1900. He later remarried Emma Rights in Santa Fe under the agreement that their children be raised Catholic—an unusual but telling compromise in an era when religious identities often ran deep. One of their daughters, Gertrude Helbig, would eventually marry a logger and homesteader from Minnesota named John Petri, uniting two immigrant legacies on the American frontier.

In his later years, Robert moved north to join his daughter Gertrude in Liberty Township, Minnesota. There, far from both Dresden and the desert mesas of New Mexico, he once again offered his skills as a cook—this time in the rough, timber-clad world of logging camps. He helped build local roads, lent his labor to community infrastructure, and remained a figure of resilience in a harsh environment. He died in 1937 at the home of his daughter Maria and was buried in Bemidji, Minnesota.

Though Dresden would later be devastated by war and rebuilt from its ruins, the city of Robert’s birth still stands as a monument to endurance and beauty. For the Helbig family, it was the place where skill and character were forged—qualities carried faithfully across the Atlantic, and handed down through generations of strong-willed pioneers.

Chapter 4: The Rudolph Family of Bempflingen, Württemberg, Germany

In the pastoral heart of Württemberg, the village of Bempflingen rests quietly along the banks of the Erms River, surrounded by orchards and vineyard-covered slopes. It is a place shaped by centuries of agrarian life, Lutheran tradition, and local craftsmanship. For generations, the Rudolph family lived here—rooted in the fertile soil of southern Germany. But like so many families in the 19th century, their eyes eventually turned westward, toward the promise and perils of a new life in America.

Jacob Rudolph was born in Bempflingen in the mid-19th century, a time when Württemberg was undergoing sweeping changes. The pressures of population growth, land division, and industrialization strained rural communities. While Bempflingen retained its agricultural character, the economic opportunities for younger sons—especially those without inheritance—were limited. By the 1890s, Württemberg was sending thousands of emigrants overseas each year, many of whom settled in America’s growing cities.

Jacob was among them. He left Germany and arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, part of a large wave of German-speaking immigrants who reshaped the city’s ethnic and cultural landscape. Philadelphia in the 1890s was a booming industrial center with deep German roots: bakeries, beer halls, and Lutheran churches dotted the neighborhoods, and German-language newspapers connected newcomers to the old country.

For immigrants like Jacob, life was far from easy. He likely found work in a trade or factory and rented space in the crowded row houses that defined immigrant Philadelphia. Yet amid the hardships, there was also community—fellow Germans who preserved traditions, shared food, and supported one another in their new surroundings.

Jacob’s daughter, Marie Rudolph, grew up in this environment. Though shaped by her German heritage, she was also a child of American urban life. Eventually, like many second-generation immigrants, Marie would move beyond the city, settling in the rural West, where she married Charles Daubel and raised a large family on a farm near Elk, Washington. In this union, the Rudolphs and Daubels—both hailing from Württemberg but arriving in America by very different paths—were joined in a new chapter of their family’s story.

Back in Bempflingen, life moved at a slower pace. The village today retains its historic charm, with timber-framed houses and quiet lanes echoing with the memory of those who once left in search of a different future. Though the Rudolphs no longer walk its fields, the values forged in that soil—faith, perseverance, and devotion to family—endured in the lives they built across an ocean.

Chapter 5: The Bartosh and Reha Families of Bohemia (Neznašov Region)

In the green hills of southern Bohemia, near the meandering Vltava River, lies the village of Neznašov—a small settlement in the historic Písek region of what is now the Czech Republic. In the 19th century, this area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a sprawling, multi-ethnic realm marked by deep social stratification and political complexity. For Czech families like the Bartoshes and Rehas, life in the countryside revolved around subsistence farming, Catholic tradition, and close-knit village life. But under the surface was a simmering desire for opportunity, land, and freedom.

Frank Bartosh was born in Neznašov on August 2, 1864. Just seven months later, he was carried in his parents’ arms across the Atlantic as part of a larger wave of Czech emigration that had begun in the 1850s. Political dissatisfaction, limited land ownership, and a growing Czech nationalist sentiment led many families to seek better lives in America—especially in the Midwest, where farmland was cheap and Czech communities were already forming.

The Bartosh family settled in Iowa, a state whose rolling plains and farming culture felt familiar to those raised in Bohemia. There, they joined a growing network of Czech-speaking farmers, many of whom continued their old-country customs, including Catholic mass, folk music, and mutual aid societies. Frank grew up in this environment, becoming a part of the first American-born generation of Bohemian immigrants.

In 1887, Frank married Mary Reha, herself likely of Bohemian heritage. Together they would raise eight children, all born in Iowa. The Reha family, like the Bartoshes, came from the Czech-speaking lands of southern Bohemia. “Reha” (Řeha in Czech) was a common surname in the region, often associated with farmers and tradespeople. Though their early married life was spent in the Midwest, Frank and Mary would not remain there forever.

In 1911, Frank moved his family to North Dakota—a new frontier in the American settlement story. The northern plains offered wide tracts of affordable land and a fresh start, though the conditions were harsh and the winters unforgiving. Frank continued to farm until his death on July 14, 1919, in Lisbon, North Dakota.

The Bohemian-American experience was one of both preservation and adaptation. Families like the Bartoshes and Rehas worked hard to retain their language, customs, and Catholic identity while also embracing the freedoms and responsibilities of life in a new land. Their journey—from the riverbanks of Neznašov to the open skies of North Dakota—is a testament to courage, endurance, and hope for the generations to come.

Chapter 6: The Cooper and Lanphere Families of Pennsylvania and New England

The story of the Cooper and Lanphere families begins not in the Old World, but in the early settlements of the American colonies—a legacy that stretches back to New England’s founding days. Unlike many of the other families in this history who arrived from Europe in the 19th century, the Coopers and Lanpheres were among those who had long been rooted in America, helping to shape the young nation from its colonial frontier through the pioneer westward migrations.

Oscar Cooper was born on April 15, 1847, in Ceres, Pennsylvania, a town straddling the New York border in the rugged Allegheny Plateau. This region had been settled by Yankees from New England seeking farmland in the early 19th century, bringing with them Puritan-descended names, industriousness, and a deep commitment to faith and family. The Cooper family had likely been part of this broader migration out of New England into the “Western Reserve” frontier lands of New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.

Oscar married Rosalthea “Rose” Angelia Lanphere on March 18, 1867. The Lanphere family name is a variant of “Lanphier” or “Lanphear,” a surname with deep roots in early Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Lanpheres were among the old colonial families—many of French Huguenot descent—who fled religious persecution in Europe in the 17th century and became part of the fabric of colonial life in New England. By the early 1800s, some Lanpheres had moved west into upstate New York and Pennsylvania, often working as farmers, craftsmen, or soldiers.

Oscar and Rose had eight children and were part of a generation that would carry America’s spirit of expansion into the wide prairies of the Dakotas. Sometime before 1884, they moved to Brown County in what was then Dakota Territory—just before statehood was granted to South Dakota in 1889. There they settled near Hecla, establishing a new life on the edge of the northern plains.

The Coopers were among thousands of settlers enticed by the promise of homesteads and opportunity. Life on the prairie was hard—harsh winters, crop failures, and isolation were common—but it was also marked by strong community bonds and the satisfaction of building something permanent. Their son, Charles Cooper, born in 1879 in Shinglehouse, Pennsylvania, would go on to continue the family legacy in South Dakota and later North Dakota and Minnesota.

In 1910, Oscar and Rose moved again—this time to Cayuga, North Dakota. Oscar passed away there in 1911, a pioneer to the end. Their journey from the Appalachian hills to the northern plains mirrors the great American story of movement, resilience, and the steady westward pull of hope.

The Cooper and Lanphere lines remind us that not all roots lie across the ocean. Some, like theirs, stretch deep into the colonial past—woven into the very soil of America’s birth and carried onward by each generation that took one more step into the frontier.

Chapter 7: The Strong Family of Early America and New York

The Strong family carries a legacy that reaches into the early colonial fabric of America. Originating from England, the first Strongs arrived in New England in the 1600s, part of the Puritan migration that laid the foundation for the colonies of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Over generations, the family spread westward—first into upstate New York, and then to the far reaches of the American frontier. Their journey is emblematic of the American experience: faith-driven, resilient, and ever-pioneering.

Walter Strong, a descendant of this long line, was born into a family already seasoned by generations of settlement in rural New York. He lived during a time when the frontier had moved west, and the nation was undergoing explosive growth and change. In the early 19th century, many New England and New York families sought better farmland and opportunity in the Midwest, encouraged by the opening of the Erie Canal and the steady push of the U.S. government to populate the interior.

Walter’s son, William Strong, carried the family name into the post-Civil War era. Like many of his generation, William was part of the great wave of settlement into the Dakota Territory, lured by homestead opportunities and the promise of land. He eventually made his way to South Dakota, where he and his descendants would help carve out a new life on the plains.

The Strongs were farmers, builders, and community members—quietly shaping the regions they settled. They valued hard work and stability and often intermarried with other established colonial families, including the Coopers and Lanpheres. The lives they led were not often recorded in detail, but they left behind the markers of perseverance: homesteads, cemeteries, and children who continued the journey west.

In 1937, Herman Daubel married Theresa Strong, a descendant of this family. Their union brought together two very different migration stories—one rooted in 19th-century German emigration, the other in the deeply entrenched colonial heritage of New England. It was a blending of frontier traditions, both immigrant and old-stock American, and a reminder that the American story has always been one of convergence.

The Strongs exemplify the enduring strength of early American families: deeply rooted, quietly influential, and always seeking new ground. Their story, stretching from English Puritan beginnings to homesteads in South Dakota and Washington, is a testament to the steady courage it takes to build something lasting.

Chapter 8: The Spence Family of Pontefract, Yorkshire, England

The market town of Pontefract lies in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire, England—a region shaped by centuries of coal mining, agriculture, and the rhythms of English country life. Known for its medieval castle, sweet licorice, and proximity to the rolling dales, Pontefract was a place where tradition ran deep. For the Spence family, this northern English town was home for generations, until the call of the New World led them to a different destiny.

John W. Spence, born in 1830, was raised in this environment of hard work and modest means. In the mid-19th century, Yorkshire was undergoing dramatic changes. The Industrial Revolution had brought factories and railways, but also dislocation and hardship. For working-class families like the Spences, emigration offered an escape from economic constraints and a chance to own land—something out of reach in the class-bound society of Victorian England.

John made the journey to America as part of the great British emigration wave that peaked in the mid-1800s. His departure from Pontefract marked a profound shift—from the soot-blackened towns of Yorkshire to the wide skies and raw opportunities of the American Midwest. While records of his early years in America are sparse, John eventually settled in rural South Dakota, part of the wave of settlers who came to farm the Dakota prairies after the Homestead Act opened millions of acres for cultivation.

John’s life in America was one of perseverance. He and his family established themselves through farming, raising crops and livestock on land that had only recently been buffalo range. Though a far cry from the lush hills of Yorkshire, the prairie offered freedom—freedom from landlords, rigid class structures, and the grinding labor of the English working class.

His daughter, Josephine Spence, became part of the broader American story of westward expansion and settlement. In time, the Spence name would be woven into the fabric of families in the Pacific Northwest, where descendants would marry into lines like the Daubels and Strongs.

Pontefract itself remains a symbol of enduring English identity. Though transformed over time, it retains its castle ruins, cobbled streets, and the market traditions that once sustained families like the Spences. The echoes of that place—its resilience, pragmatism, and quiet strength—traveled across the sea in the hearts of emigrants like John W. Spence, and they remain alive in the character of his descendants.
