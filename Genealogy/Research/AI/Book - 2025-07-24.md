**Title: From Old World Roots to Western Pines: A Family Story**

# Introduction

This book traces the story of sixteen interconnected families across four generations—from their European origins to their lives in frontier America, and eventually into towns and cities of the Inland Northwest. These narratives preserve the cultural and personal legacies of the Petri, Helbig, Daubel, Cooper, Strong, Bartosh, Reha, Rudolph, Spence, and other families that contributed to this lineage.

Each chapter is dedicated to a family surname, providing context, biography, and family trees that show how these lines converged and evolved.

# Chapter 1: The Petri Family

## Origins in Europe

The Petri family hailed from Rumelange, Luxembourg—a town transformed by the iron mining boom of the late 19th century. Nestled in the Red Lands near the French border, Rumelange rapidly evolved from a quiet rural village into an industrial hub teeming with migrant laborers and multilingual communities. It became known for its iron ore, extracted from the distinctive red rock beneath the hills, and fed the region’s growing steel industry.

John Petri was born here in 1875, in the midst of industrialization. The Petri family would have been part of the Catholic working class, navigating the challenges of factory life, fluctuating employment, and urban expansion. French, German, and Luxembourgish were spoken interchangeably, and the influence of nearby France shaped both Rumelange’s culture and its labor practices. The town, while offering employment, also suffered from overcrowding and limited economic mobility, which may have prompted the young John to seek opportunities abroad.

## Emigration to America

In 1891, sixteen-year-old John Petri left Luxembourg and boarded a vessel bound for the United States. Though specific ship records are still being confirmed, his immigration aligns with a large wave of German-speaking immigrants from Luxembourg and the surrounding regions who passed through Castle Garden or the Barge Office in New York.

John’s initial destination was Avon, Minnesota, in Stearns County. This area was home to a thriving German-Catholic community and provided a welcoming environment for recent immigrants. It offered rich farmland, growing towns, and the stabilizing presence of Benedictine monasteries and parishes that helped maintain cultural continuity. In Avon, John would have found familiar language, customs, and liturgical life.

But the call of the frontier drew him north. John moved to Beltrami County—then a sparsely settled land of pine forests, rivers, and logging trails. There, in Liberty Township, he began to carve out a new life as a logger and settler.

## Life on the American Frontier

In Liberty Township, John Petri built a life that merged rugged labor with civic service. He filed for homestead land in an area where the timber industry drove economic development. Logging camps were scattered throughout the forested north, and settlers cleared trees both for profit and to make way for farming.

John married Gertrude Helbig, a young woman born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to German immigrant parents. Theirs was likely a mail-order arrangement, a not-uncommon practice that matched frontier bachelors with brides from immigrant communities elsewhere. Despite the distance and differences in upbringing, John and Gertrude forged a partnership suited to the demands of frontier life.

John became deeply involved in his local community, serving as a Justice of the Peace and U.S. Postmaster—a rare achievement for a recent immigrant. He balanced his duties with the physical demands of logging and maintaining the homestead.

His life ended prematurely in a logging accident, leaving Gertrude widowed with five young children. Yet his contributions laid the foundation for a family legacy that would endure across generations.

# Chapter 2: The Helbig Family

## Origins in Europe

The Helbig family lived in Dresden, Saxony—one of Germany’s most celebrated cultural capitals. Known as the “Florence on the Elbe,” Dresden was renowned for its art, architecture, and intellectual life. But beneath its grand facade, the city was also an emerging industrial center. In the late 19th century, the artisan trades—including baking, printing, and metalwork—flourished alongside factories and rail depots.

Robert Helbig was born into this world of disciplined labor and rising industrial modernity. He worked as a baker—one of the most respected trades in the growing city—and likely honed his skills in a local guild. Though Dresden provided opportunities, it also imposed limitations on working-class families: mandatory military service, limited property rights, and social rigidity. These pressures likely contributed to Robert’s decision to emigrate.

## Emigration to America

Robert Helbig arrived in the United States in 1881. He made his way west to Santa Fe, New Mexico—an unusual path for a Saxon immigrant. Santa Fe, then a growing regional center, was steeped in cultural complexity. Its blend of Spanish, Native American, and Anglo influences stood in stark contrast to the old-world order of Dresden.

Robert worked as a baker and later as a vocational instructor at the Albuquerque Indian School. There, he taught Native American students baking and industrial skills as part of the federal government’s assimilation efforts. His work placed him at the intersection of U.S. expansionism and education policy.

## Life on the American Frontier

Tragedy marked Robert’s early years in America—his first wife and two daughters died young. He later remarried Emma Rights under the condition that their children be raised Catholic. His daughter, Gertrude Helbig, was born into a bicultural, multilingual environment where resilience was necessary for survival. When Gertrude married John Petri and moved to northern Minnesota, she brought with her the grit and adaptability instilled by her father’s experiences.

# Chapter 3: The Daubel Family

## Origins in Europe

The Daubel family originated in Bonfeld, a small village in the Neckar Valley of Württemberg, Germany. Bonfeld was a picturesque community surrounded by orchards and vineyards, where Lutheran values and skilled trades shaped daily life. Ludwig Daubel, born in 1839, worked as a blacksmith—a respected profession in a land where every village depended on its craftsmen.

After the failed revolutions of 1848 and increased militarization of German society, many families in Württemberg grew concerned about mandatory military service and limited upward mobility. For Ludwig, emigration represented a chance to preserve family integrity and provide freedom for his sons.

## Emigration to America

In 1885, Ludwig Daubel applied for permission to emigrate and brought his family to Hanover, Kansas—a prairie town settled largely by German immigrants. He arrived with 3,000 marks in savings (approximately $20,000 today), which helped him reestablish his blacksmith shop and begin farming.

Hanover offered cultural familiarity—German churches, schools, and newspapers helped ease the transition. Ludwig’s sons received both education and training in agriculture and trades.

## Life on the American Frontier

By the late 1890s, the Daubel sons were eager for new frontiers. Railroad land grants and promotional campaigns drew them to the Pacific Northwest. One by one, the sons moved west, claiming land near Elk, Washington. Eventually, Ludwig and his wife followed.

In Elk, Ludwig resumed his blacksmithing trade and contributed to building the physical and social fabric of the new community. His legacy would be carried on by his son Charles and grandson Herman.

# Chapter 4: The Rudolph Family

## Origins in Europe

Jacob Rudolph was born in Bempflingen, Württemberg—a rural village surrounded by the foothills of the Swabian Jura. The area was known for its fruit production, pietistic Lutheranism, and tight-knit social fabric. Like many rural Germans in the 19th century, the Rudolphs faced challenges from overpopulation, limited inheritance opportunities, and increasing centralization under the German Empire.

## Emigration to America

Jacob Rudolph emigrated to the United States in the 1890s, settling in Philadelphia—a thriving industrial city with a well-established German immigrant community. Lutheran churches, social clubs, and German-language newspapers made it easier to maintain cultural ties.

## Life on the American Frontier

Jacob worked in the skilled trades or factories and raised his family in a modest rowhouse. His daughter Marie inherited the values of thrift, discipline, and strong family loyalty. She later married Charles Daubel and moved to northeastern Washington, where she embraced farm life with resourcefulness and dedication.

Marie raised eleven children in a rural setting, applying the organizational sensibilities and resilience inherited from her urban upbringing. Her transformation from city dweller to homesteader illustrates the adaptability at the heart of immigrant success stories.

# Chapter 5: The Cooper Family

## Origins in America

The Coopers were part of early English migration to New England. By the 1800s, they had moved into Pennsylvania and New York, farming marginal lands and contributing to local civic life. Oscar Cooper was born in Ceres, Pennsylvania, in 1847—a community on the fringe of the settled frontier.

## Life on the American Frontier

Oscar married Rosalthea Lanphere and moved his family west to South Dakota during the homesteading boom of the 1880s. In the harsh climate of the Dakota plains, Oscar and his children carved out a life through sheer determination. They raised livestock and crops in a landscape that demanded resilience.

Oscar’s son Charles Cooper continued the family’s westward journey. After marrying twice and raising children from both unions, he moved to Bemidji, Minnesota, where he integrated into the Petri family through marriage to Anna Bartosh.

# Chapter 6: The Strong Family

## Origins in America

The Strong family traced their lineage to early English Puritans. Over generations, they moved from colonial Massachusetts into upstate New York and eventually into the Midwest. Their migration reflected a common pattern among 18th- and 19th-century American families seeking land and religious freedom.

## Life on the American Frontier

William Strong settled in the upper Midwest and raised a family grounded in Christian ethics and self-sufficiency. His daughter Thressa was born in this environment and later moved to Washington State, where she married Herman Daubel.

Thressa helped manage a working farm and raised six children. Her life—marked by hard work, family devotion, and cultural continuity—illustrates the blend of English-American and Germanic traditions that defined many frontier families.

# Chapter 7: The Bartosh and Reha Families

## Origins in Europe

The Bartosh and Reha families came from the Písek region of southern Bohemia. These Czech-speaking families were shaped by centuries of Habsburg rule, Catholic identity, and rural village life. Their villages—like Neznašov—were agricultural hubs rooted in seasonal rhythms and folk customs.

## Emigration to America

Frank Bartosh came to the United States as an infant in 1865, part of a larger wave of Czech migration following the failed 1848 revolutions. The family settled in Iowa, where Czech communities had formed around shared language, religion, and cultural practices.

## Life on the American Frontier

Frank married Mary Reha in 1887, and they raised eight children on their Iowa farm. The family preserved Czech traditions, language, and Catholicism. In 1911, they moved to North Dakota in search of more land.

Their lives on the prairie were difficult but rewarding. They were part of a close-knit Czech-American network that valued education, music, and community cohesion.

# Chapter 8: The Spence Family

## Origins in Europe

The Spence family came from Pontefract, Yorkshire—a coal-mining town steeped in medieval history and industrial labor. Life in 19th-century Yorkshire was tough, particularly for working-class families who lived in terraced housing and toiled in mines, factories, or as teamsters.

## Emigration to America

John W. Spence was born in 1830 and immigrated to the United States as a young man. He settled in Defiance, Ohio, a growing trade town that offered new opportunities for landownership and labor.

## Life on the American Frontier

John moved westward with the expansion of the frontier, eventually arriving in Washington State. He worked as a teamster, hauling goods and materials across the rugged terrain of the inland Northwest.

His daughter, Josephine Spence, carried forward the family’s legacy by marrying into the Daubel family. Her life bridged the Old World of Yorkshire with the pioneering spirit of the American West.
