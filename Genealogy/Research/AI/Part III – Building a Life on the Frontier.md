📘 Part III – Building a Life on the Frontier

Homesteading, Logging, and the Making of New Communities

As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, the American frontier was still very real. While the East was becoming urbanized and industrial, the Northwoods of Minnesota, the high plains of the Dakotas, and the dense forests of Washington remained wild, open, and sparsely settled. It was in these spaces—often cold, hard, and unforgiving—that your ancestors built lasting lives.

They cleared land, felled trees, broke prairie soil, and built not just homes but communities: schools, churches, post offices, sawmills, and town halls. Their work formed the backbone of emerging towns. They raised large families, suffered loss, celebrated harvests, and helped shape the frontier into something livable—and even beautiful.

Matthias Petri and Family – Pioneers of Liberty Township, Minnesota

After John Petri’s untimely death, his eldest son Matthias Petri stepped into adulthood early, taking responsibility on the family homestead in Liberty Township, Minnesota. Born in the rugged Northwoods, Matthias knew logging, farming, and hard labor from a young age. The family farm remained their anchor through the 1910s and 1920s, nestled in the forests outside Bemidji.

Matthias represented the first generation of American-born Petris. His life was shaped by the rough but promising environment of Beltrami County: cold winters, thick woods, and a community built on mutual support. Though little is recorded about him, Matthias’s adult years reflect the slow, persistent transformation of the frontier into a stable home—one built on the back of his labor.

John Petri and Gertrude Helbig – From Santa Fe, NM to Pioneers of Liberty Township, Minnesota

John Petri, a Luxembourg immigrant, settled in Liberty Township in the early 1900s, staking a claim in the pine-covered wilderness of northern Minnesota. He had arrived in the U.S. in 1891 and worked his way into logging camps and frontier towns before finding land of his own.

His marriage to Gertrude Helbig, a mail-order bride from Santa Fe, New Mexico, was both unconventional and symbolic of the vast diversity of American frontiers. Gertrude, born to a Saxon baker in the multicultural Southwest, brought with her a strength that matched the harsh conditions of rural Minnesota.

Together they raised five children, relying on John’s income from logging and civic service. As Justice of the Peace and U.S. Postmaster, John played a vital role in the township’s early development. His death in a logging accident left Gertrude a young widow, but she managed to raise the children and sustain the homestead—later remarrying and living to the age of 99. Their union, brief but fruitful, left a legacy rooted in resilience.

Robert Petrie and Gladys Cooper – From Logging Camps to Spokane’s Urban Life

Robert Petrie, son of John and Gertrude, inherited the grit of the northern pines. Born in Liberty Township in 1904, he worked as a logger and carpenter, part of the rough-and-tumble timber industry that defined the Northwoods. In the early 1930s, he married Gladys Cooper, a North Dakota native whose own family had homesteaded the plains. Gladys worked as a cook in the logging camps, feeding hungry crews in remote outposts.

Their story follows a wider westward movement. In 1937, they left Minnesota and headed west, spending time in Conrad, Montana, and Wallace, Idaho, before settling in Spokane, Washington. There, Robert continued his carpentry and eventually owned a small store. Gladys became an operating room nurse, moving from camp life into the professional world. Together they raised three sons—Milton, Vern, and Dale—and frequently traveled back to Minnesota to visit family.

Their journey marks a turning point: a shift from rural subsistence to working-class urban life, with roots deep in both worlds.

Ludwig Daubel – Blacksmith and Pioneer Settler from Kansas to Washington

Ludwig Daubel, born in Bonfeld, Germany, brought his blacksmithing skills to Hanover, Kansas in 1885. He was the patriarch of the Daubel family in America, determined to give his sons freedom from conscription and opportunity for land. After several years in Kansas, Ludwig followed his sons to Elk, Washington, where they had claimed land under railroad expansion programs.

There, Ludwig helped forge not only tools and implements but the early infrastructure of a new frontier community. His trade was essential in an area where every wagon wheel, axe head, and plow needed careful maintenance. His life bridged the Old World and New, rural Württemberg and the wilds of the Pacific Northwest.

Charles and Marie Daubel – Builders of the Elk, Washington Homestead

Charles Daubel, Ludwig’s son, settled near Elk, Washington, with his wife Marie Rudolph, a Philadelphia-born daughter of German immigrants. They raised eleven children on a diversified farm, growing fruit and grains, raising livestock, and operating a small sawmill and a blacksmith shop.

Marie gave birth to all eleven children at home with the help of a neighbor midwife. The family harvested ice in the winter from the mill pond, stored it in sawdust-filled icehouses, and used it for cooling food and making ice cream—sharing it with neighbors in a spirit of community.

Charles was a stern but industrious father, remembered for dragging fainting sons into the shade before returning them to work. The Daubel farm was not just a home—it was a production hub for the community: grinding grain, fixing tools, and sawing lumber for barns and homes throughout the area.

Herman Daubel and Theresa Strong – Woodsmen, Farmers, and Modern Workers

Herman Daubel, son of Charles and Marie, grew up in the rugged Elk countryside. He attended the Muhle School and Deer Creek School, walking three miles through forests so wild that cougar sightings sometimes canceled recess. As a teen, he drove a horse-drawn wagon to Milan, Washington, and worked for Spokane Lumber Company and later Edwards and Bradford in Elk.

In 1937, Herman married Theresa Strong, whose ancestors had come from colonial New England and the Cooper family of North Dakota. They farmed, logged, and raised six children. Later, Herman worked for Kaiser Aluminum, transitioning from pioneer trades to modern industry.

The Daubel–Strong household blended German, English, and Czech heritage into a life that echoed the frontier while embracing the emerging 20th century.

Frank and Mary Bartosh – Czech Farmers on the Dakota Plains

Born in Bohemia and raised in Iowa, Frank Bartosh married Mary Reha and fathered eight children before moving to Lisbon, North Dakota in 1911. There, they joined a small but determined group of Czech-speaking settlers on the wind-swept plains.

Life was difficult. The land was open, the weather harsh, and services few. Yet the Bartoshes built a farm, grew crops, and maintained strong Catholic traditions. Frank died in 1919, leaving Mary a widow in a raw and developing landscape—but their children continued the work they had begun.

Their story reflects the classic Bohemian-American frontier experience: cultural cohesion, fierce work ethic, and unwavering faith in the face of hardship.
