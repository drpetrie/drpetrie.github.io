📘 Part I – European Roots

Before the Crossing: Homeland Stories and the Forces That Drove Them

Across the 19th century, Europe was a continent in motion. Empires rose and fell, borders shifted, and economies evolved in ways that placed pressure on ordinary families across the continent. In the quiet villages of Germany and Bohemia, in the industrial valleys of Luxembourg, and in the coal towns of England’s North, families like the Petris, Daubels, Coopers, Strongs, Bartoshes, Rehas, Rudolphs, and Spences lived for generations—tied to the land, the church, the seasons, and the centuries-old customs of their people.

Yet something changed. Whether it was the slow creep of industrialization, the threat of military conscription, the grip of rigid social hierarchies, or simply the allure of a better life elsewhere, these families found themselves looking west. But before they sailed for the United States, they were shaped—deeply and lastingly—by the lands they called home.

Chapter 1: The Petri Family of Rumelange, Luxembourg

In the south of Luxembourg, close to the border with France, lies the town of Rumelange—a place defined by the iron veins beneath its hills. During the mid-1800s, Rumelange transformed from a rural hamlet into a booming industrial town as iron ore was discovered and exploited. The region became part of the so-called “Red Lands,” and Luxembourg itself pivoted from a largely agrarian economy to one driven by mining and metallurgy.

The iron boom created jobs, but at a cost. Life in Rumelange was hard: families lived in smoky, soot-laced valleys, working long shifts in dangerous pits or furnaces. The town attracted workers from across Luxembourg and neighboring France and Germany, creating a multilingual, working-class environment. The Petri family belonged to this world—rooted in a Catholic tradition and surrounded by the sounds of French, German, and Luxembourgish.

Though Rumelange offered employment, land was scarce, and social mobility limited. For a young man like John Petri, born in 1875, the path forward may have felt narrow. He came of age during a time of intense change—when new rail lines carried ore to the steelworks, but also carried dreams of distant lands. Before long, John would make his way to America.

Chapter 2: The Daubel Family of Bonfeld, Württemberg

Bonfeld, a village nestled in the rolling hills of the Neckar Valley in southwestern Germany, belonged to the Kingdom of Württemberg—one of the constituent states of the German Confederation in the 19th century. With a population of only a few hundred, Bonfeld was an agrarian village, known for its vineyards, orchards, and artisanal trades. It was a land of half-timbered houses, Lutheran piety, and well-ordered village life, where families like the Daubels worked as blacksmiths, farmers, and craftsmen.

Ludwig Daubel was born here in 1839, at a time when Württemberg was undergoing economic strain and political unrest. The failed revolutions of 1848 had left behind a more centralized, militarized government, and young men faced compulsory military service—often for years. As mechanization slowly began to impact traditional trades, many skilled workers like Ludwig saw their livelihoods threatened.

For Ludwig, the blacksmith’s forge provided honest work and modest prosperity, but it also anchored his sons in a society that demanded obedience and gave little room for personal advancement. The decision to emigrate would not come lightly—but it was already forming as conditions grew more rigid at home.

Chapter 3: The Cooper and Strong Families of Pennsylvania and New England

The Coopers and Strongs had already called America home for centuries by the time they moved west. Their roots traced back to the earliest English settlers in the 1600s—Puritans who landed in New England, building communities based on strict religious principles and agrarian independence.

By the early 1800s, members of these families had migrated into upstate New York and northern Pennsylvania. There, in rugged, forested terrain, they continued farming and raising large families. These were people shaped by Revolutionary War ideals, Protestant ethic, and a belief in self-sufficiency. The land was hardscrabble, but it was theirs. Oscar Cooper was born in 1847 in Ceres, Pennsylvania, a town straddling the New York border that was part of the larger westward migration wave from New England.

The Strong family, descended from early colonial settlers, shared a similar trajectory—moving out of Massachusetts and Connecticut and into western New York, eventually reaching into the upper Midwest. They were part of what historian Frederick Jackson Turner later called the “frontier thesis”: families who continuously moved west as each new frontier opened.

By the mid-1800s, the frontier was pushing into the Dakota Territory—and the Cooper and Strong families would be among those who followed.

Chapter 4: The Bartosh and Reha Families of Bohemia

In the heart of the Austrian Empire, the Czech-speaking village of Neznašov lay in the lush hills of southern Bohemia, not far from the Vltava River. The Písek region, known for its ancient stone bridge and deep medieval history, was primarily agrarian, with small farms passed down through generations. Families like the Bartoshes and Rehas lived by the church calendar, tilling small plots and navigating the rigid structures of imperial rule.

Though culturally rich, Bohemia was socially stagnant for many rural families. Czech peasants had limited rights under the Habsburg system. Land was often inherited by a single heir, leaving younger children with few prospects. Ethnic tensions between Czech speakers and German authorities also added pressure, as did rising nationalism and economic strain.

By the mid-1800s, the wave of Czech emigration to America had begun, especially after the revolutions of 1848 and the collapse of many peasant hopes. For families like the Bartoshes and Rehas, America represented a chance for land ownership and cultural freedom—opportunities long denied in the empire’s feudal system. The seeds of departure were planted, even before Frank Bartosh was born in 1864.

Chapter 5: The Rudolph Family of Bempflingen, Württemberg

Bempflingen, a small village southeast of Stuttgart, sits along the Erms River amid fields of fruit trees and Swabian hills. In the 19th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Württemberg—a Lutheran stronghold known for its conservative rural culture and well-organized villages. Life in Bempflingen revolved around farming, winemaking, and village trades.

Jacob Rudolph was born into this setting, where generations of Swabian farmers had worked the same land. But like many villages in the region, Bempflingen faced population growth and a lack of opportunity for younger sons. The social structure was orderly—but inflexible. Land was expensive, and inheritance customs often left only one heir per farmstead. For enterprising men like Jacob, the constraints of the Old World were becoming intolerable.

At the same time, the idea of America—vast, free, and teeming with opportunity—was beginning to take hold across Württemberg, fueled by letters home and the growing success of chain migration networks. Jacob’s eyes would soon turn across the Atlantic.

Chapter 6: The Spence Family of Pontefract, Yorkshire

Pontefract, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, was an ancient town with a layered past—once a Norman stronghold, now a hub of coal mining, agriculture, and sweet licorice production. By the mid-19th century, the industrial revolution had left its mark. Rows of terraced brick homes housed miners, factory workers, and tradesmen who lived by the shift whistle and Sabbath bell.

The Spence family lived in this environment of industrial England—caught between tradition and transformation. As the British Empire expanded abroad, working-class families at home often faced declining wages, poor housing, and limited prospects. Social mobility was rare. The rigid class structure of Victorian Britain made landownership nearly impossible for those outside the gentry.

John W. Spence, born in 1830, came of age in this world. In Pontefract, he would have known the sounds of carts on cobblestones, the smoke from coal fires, and the weight of expectation. For men like John, the only way to rise was to leave. America, with its railroads and homesteads, offered what Yorkshire could not: a chance to own land and escape the confines of class.
