I found an interview with a guy named Albert Canwell. He was a State Representative from 1946-1947. He was known for anti-communist hearings. He lived just a little ways up the Mt. Spokane road off of Bill Gulch Rd as a child. There is a Canwell Lane Road there today. He lived there from 1909 - 1916. He was interviewed as part of an oral history project. The original interview is over 400 pages. I have selected the parts that discuss him living in the Mt. Spokane area and created this file.

Albert F. Canwell

11 Jan 1907 - 1 Apr 2002

**Mr. Canwell** : I remember our–I don’t know whether this is the time to go into it–but when we moved to the place up in the Mount Spokane foothills area it was a very primitive place at that time and it took a woman of real substance to do it–to put up with the rugged life there. I remember certain things like my mother and her Singer sewing machine. It seemed to me it was going all the time. During the same time there’s a steamer of hot water heating on the stove. She was forever doing laundry and forever sewing.

We had sheep and we saved the wool; I can remember her washing the wool and carding with these hand carders. Then she would make crazy quilts or comforters. She would sew these things together with these wool pads. For many years we had those comforters. They were delightful and effective, but they were the product of my mother’s genius and endeavors. She was working all the time. And it was a rugged life.

I remember highlights of life in the foothills; I must have been about five, and the logging companies were coming in there and cutting the big timber. It was a beautiful area and they cut down these trees. I would watch them fell them and even at that time I had a very sorrowful feeling about it. Typically, there were a lot of rough characters who came in with the logging operations.

I recall one incident distinctly where this man, a very mean-looking character, came up to our door and asked for a cup of coffee. My mother was fearful of the situation and she said, “Well, you’ll have to get your coffee from the neighbor. You go over there and he’ll make one.” And this lumberjack, if that’s what he was, said, “Well, I want you to make me some coffee,” and he was becoming obviously somewhat quite oppressive.

My mother signaled to me or whispered to me to get the rifle. We kept a .22 rifle and my dad’s 30-30 on the racks above the door. I got a chair and got the .22. There was a chipmunk running down a rock wall and my mother aimed at it and blew it to pieces.

This character said, “Oh, you shoot, don’t you?” My mother said, “Yes, and I’d just as soon shoot a man.”

And so, he took off and she was shaking for an hour afterwards. She was really frightened, but she did her thing there and I think had he continued aggressively, she would have stopped him. But she was normally a very peace-loving person.

**Mr. Frederick**: Have you heard through family folklore why your mother and father settled in Spokane?

**Mr. Canwell**: Ah, the only thing that we could ever put together on this was that he had been up here and looked around and the hills around Spokane were very similar to the area he came from in Maine. While he never said so that I know of, that’s the conclusion that several of us drew after seeing the Maine area where he came from.

I place some of these dates by piecing things together. I know that we moved to this farm property up near Mount Spokane in 1909.

**Mr. Frederick**: We haven’t taken the opportunity to describe the brothers and sisters of your mother.

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, the only one I knew was her brother, Aaron. He lived with us for a time in the place up in the hills and was killed in an accident up there when I was six. A limb blew out of a tree and hit him on the head. It was what they called a “widow maker” in those days. And that was a very tragic thing, too. There were no doctors up there and my father was gone at the time it occurred–a very unhappy thing.

It was a severe blow. If Aaron had not been a very, very rugged, strong individual, he never could have walked from the scene of the accident to the house. He was almost unconscious. He never really recovered. When my father returned, he was unable to find a doctor who could assist. Uncle Aaron died a day or two later.

There was a little rock garden sort of place near the house that had some trees and I would go out there to play and build make-believe pastures or cow pens, or other things. You’d go through a trash heap to find a dish that had been broken that might have a colored pattern in it or something, and you would improvise; they became toys. With a little fantasy they became real; that’s the sort of thing children do. I’ll never forget I was in my little particular play area when my uncle Aaron came walking by there with his head and face all covered with blood. That is one of the things I remember about the little play area that I developed which was strictly mine.

**Mr. Frederick**: I was thinking that he would be back in the Spokane area about 1900; you were born in 1907, your first memories would be at two and a half or three, so we’re up into about 1911 or 1912.

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, I remember distinctly going up to the place in the hills the first time. It was in the fall. I was about two and half years old and we rode the conveyance that was provided by the logging camp that went up the road below our place. So we had to walk from there up, oh, nearly a mile to get to where our house was. I remember walking along with my mother on that trip. And I remember the beautiful tamarack trees. It was in the fall and they’d turned yellow. We finally got up there to this place and there had been a garden planted up there. There were tomatoes just ripened along the fence. I remember that distinctly and I know that was in 1909–in the fall of 1909.

**Mr. Canwell**: My father? My father was, well, in the first place he was a very attractive man. But a person with a high regard for the law and that sort of thing. He would not break the law and he was not aggressive. But I always felt he kind of had a chip on his shoulder, hoping somebody would knock it off. He was a very self-possessed, very determined individual.

To describe him best, I suppose, I’d go back to our time up in the hills. The place was peopled by refugees from Tennessee and other places whose main talent was moonshining. There’s only one thing those hillbillies respected, that was somebody who could shoot better than they did. So my father immediately had very good standing up there in that regard.

I remember one or two incidents having to do with his shooting. One time there was a hawk circling around above our chickens. It was away high in the sky. He went in and got the 30-30, aimed, and bingo, the feathers flew and he walked away as though it was an everyday occurrence. Pure accident, I think, that he hit the hawk. But he was that much of a con man, he didn’t want anybody to think it was at all accidental.

Another time there was a neighbor who had a dog, a hound, a Great Dane type, a vicious thing that ranged all over the hills. One day my father came home and this dog was on the back porch and wasn’t going to let him in. So he went around the house and got his rifle and by that time the dog got the message and was heading down over the hill, probably 200 yards away, making his last leap before he’d be out of sight, and my dad picked him off.

The owners of the dog were a weird lot. They had a preacher come out from town and hold a funeral over this dog. Well, that was just one of the crazy things that happened.

Another time our milk cow strayed away and my father trailed it over toward Newman Lake. Our place was about four miles through the woods from Newman Lake, but we never went that way because it was out of the way. This rustler lived over there; he lived on rustling cattle, among other things, and sold those to a packing house in Spokane. That’s probably another phase we’ll go into, but in my father’s following the trail of this cow he met this man and two or three of his thugs on the trail.

This man, Hungerford, said, “Where are you going, Canwell?”

And my dad said, “I understand you have one of my cows.”

And he didn’t question it at all, he said, “How much is it worth?”

And my dad said, “Well, I’d say a hundred dollars.” Probably $20 would have been a fairer price at that time. And so this man shelled out the gold coins and paid him. They were confronted by this bunch of his thugs and my father and the men with Hungerford said, “You don’t have to pay him for that cow,” or words to that effect.

Anyway, Hungerford said, “Well, you can commit suicide if you want, but my life’s worth a hundred dollars.” That was a confrontation that taught Hungerford a lesson.

Hungerford used to deal with the packing house in Spokane and he supplied a great deal of the stolen beef to it. The man who ran the packing house eventually became a very respected banker in Spokane, but somewhere along the line he also was caught up in his rustling deal and went to the penitentiary. His family still runs their bank; I debate whether to name them or not. They never were very friendly to me.

But that’s the type of man my father was. He was completely competent, completely fearless, not a braggart or that sort of thing at all. He was just a good citizen, but very sure of himself.

You were asking me to describe my father. He was, I would say, about 5’8” or thereabouts and probably weighed around 160 or 170 pounds, and quite an attractive man as such things go. He was not bearded, but for a time he did wear a mustache.

I was going to describe his relationship with the family and so on. He was a very stern, rigid disciplinarian. My mother would always say, “Well, I’ll tell your father on you.” He had a razor strop, as everybody did in those days, and he’d make gestures with it, but I never remember him ever laying it on anybody. But everybody thought he would and that was all that was necessary.

I remember one incident where he was building something up at our place in the hills. Nails were very, very precious–they were hard to come by. And I asked him where nails came from. He told me they grew on bushes. Then he went in to have lunch and I took his nails and planted them. That was really infuriating to him and he took after me and I retreated to my mother’s protection. She said, “Well, you shouldn’t lie to him, that’s all your fault.” She was very much against misleading or that sort of thing, although he was just being humorous.

Another time I infuriated him. I called him a “son-bitch” because he had hit me. So again he took after me and my mother wouldn’t let him touch me because she said, “There’s only one place he could have learned that.”

My mother was extremely sharp. She–like our daughter, Christina–should have been a district attorney. My mother was very, very sharp and my father was no equal to her that way. The only way he could get any relief at all was to start swearing. He had a vocabulary that was learned in the cavalry and it was a dandy. Well, that would shut my mother up. So, anyway, I remember those things about him.

He was not a very scholarly person. He didn’t read much, though he always read the newspapers. Beyond that, he was not a bookish individual and we didn’t have many books. I remember in the hills we had a dictionary, a Bible and a few assorted books, but not many.

**Mr. Frederick**: How did he express affection or approval?

**Mr. Canwell**: Ah, he was not a very expressive person. He was stern. You just knew that he meant what he said. He wanted order and discipline. He wanted obedience, but there was nothing mean about him. As far as affection, other than a pat on the back or shoulder, I can’t ever remember his expressing affection by hugging or kissing children. He may have, I don’t remember it. I was in such awe of him. I always was afraid I would fail him in what I was doing.

I remember one time we were over on Green Bluff, which was about three miles from our farm, picking strawberries. He wanted to go back to take care of the cattle. I walked with him back that three miles. Well, I just couldn’t keep up with him, but I was unwilling to say that I couldn’t and I’d trot along. It about killed me. But he was thinking about other things, I suppose, as I was trotting along. That gives you more of an idea of my attitude toward him.

**Mr. Frederick**: Albert, last session we left off with discussion regarding your father, which had to do with pastime or hobbies.

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, I would say that his hobbies were very few. Trying to recall what he did in that area, I do remember in addition to his spending a great deal of time shooting, that he also played a terrific game of checkers. I never could beat him. I don’t know if anybody in the family ever could and I suspect that he probably had perfected that during the long winter nights in Alaska.

There was not to my recollection any card playing at home. I think that probably was partly due to the fact that my mother disapproved of it anyway. And there just wasn’t time for it. In those days, particularly when we lived in the hills, your source of lighting was either the natural sources or a kerosene lamp. They were very inefficient, but they did give you some light. There was no occasion for very much evening playing of games and it was even difficult to read. Doing your schoolwork, it was never easy to have the proper lighting, but we did survive it.

As to other things my father did, he worked; he was a very busy person. I never think of him as ever spending an idle moment. He’d be doing something and, of course, there were always innumerable chores to do. At that time and period in history, you didn’t have the conveniences that you have now, so you had to carry water and store it. You had to provide wood and it had to be split and brought inside. Most of those chores were delegated to the children as they got big enough to do it.

I can’t think of much time spent in organized recreation. We did play games outdoors. The games that children played. And we always had dogs, some wonderful ones. The time was occupied and there wasn’t much mischief to get into nor an inclination to do so. Nor was it very safe to do anything that was forbidden as far as the family discipline program went.

My father’s presence in the family, as I look back, was more from the standpoint of what he worked at. He was always working at something. When he was employed for gainful employment the income was always very low. It was never enough for a large family, but that was not unique to our case– that was the case of most people we knew.

His skills were such skills as he had developed in the military. Beyond that he–well, he was not a businessman. He had no inclinations in that direction. Any books that were kept, finances handled, all went through my mother’s hands. When he’d come home with a check, it was given to her. And if he needed money for tobacco or carfare or whatever, he got it from my mother. That’s the way the thing worked. It was just convenient for him and a practical way of handling our limited finances.

When we were living in the hills, he worked–I mentioned this the other day–in the blacksmith’s shop of the logging camp. He had skills that were useful there, skills that he had developed in the cavalry.

**Mr. Frederick**: And did you have an opportunity as a child to wear shoes through the summertime?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, we had shoes and I can remember going barefoot quite a lot. But we usually had shoes of some sort.

**Mr. Frederick**: So it would have been your option, if you could have gone barefoot you would have?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, yes, and you usually wanted to. You couldn’t wait for the weather to completely adjust, summer, before you were out hopping around barefooted. And part of that, I think, had to do with the fact that the shoes were darned uncomfortable. They weren’t made and fitted the way they are nowadays. People talk about the good old days; they are talking through their hats.

But everything was that way. You lived and worked and played with what was possible. Nobody went to the store and bought toys or things, they were made at home if you had any. And if a girl had a doll it was made and stuffed and decorated at home. And usually they had them.

But for boys you were lucky if in the winter you had a sled that was of good quality. Almost nobody had a bicycle. Sometimes some rich kid or two at the school would have a bike, but never up in the hills–there he might have a horse. But even though they were available, the hill country kids walked to school. If they had horses they were used at home for work or if they took them to school they had to be fed and cared for and it just wasn’t done.

I can remember some of the hillbillies up there would walk to school eight or ten miles. We were about four miles from the school, but we walked.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did you have access to rubber boots in the wintertime?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, they were very cumbersome things and they had a thick felt inner stocking you could wear. If you were fortunate enough to have those, they kind of helped fill up the space in the rubber boot. But it was not too desirable to wear that sort in hiking to school. They were too uncomfortable to. Too hard to wear.

I can remember sometimes when there would be real deep snow that my mother would take gunnysacks and fold them in the right shape and then with a sack needle would sew these things so they’d stay on. And they were wonderful. They did the job and in dry snow they were just perfect. That was not just done by our family, it was quite often done.

**Mr. Frederick**: Now would they–that burlap–would that be used as an overshoe to your leather shoes?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, it could be either. If you’re leather shoes were comfortable and served the purpose, you might put them over. But you could do it with the bare foot, too, but just thicker amount. They could be fitted very comfortably and stay on, sewn on with these wheat sacks, needle and thread that they used. And that was not unusual. Then you’d get down to school and you’d take them off.

One year I went to this school down there, there were always things drying on this big stove. Some of these hillbillies never bathed. They didn’t have such facilities and weren’t too concerned about it. Sometimes they would hang their clothes by the stove in the school to dry and the odor was just terrific.

But I think back to some of those things, they were annoying and amusing. We came from a more civilized background than a lot of those children up there. Many of their parents were strictly moonshining hillbillies who came from Tennessee or that area. I suppose most of them were on the dodge one way or another. But, anyway, they raised their brood of kids and most of them would try to see that they got some education, so they’d get them to school. You were lucky if you didn’t have to sit by one of them. They used to have those double seats and a double desk, and so you were very fortunate if you drew somebody to sit by who was compatible in various ways.

Maybe I’m wandering here. But that was a problem. Foot gear was also a terrific problem because you had to negotiate these miles to school through snow and sometimes mud and slush. Usually whatever you were wearing in the way of leather shoes would be thoroughly wet and saturated.

When we first went up there the area had not been logged off up that far and there was beautiful timber and a lot of wildlife. By the time the older children would be getting home from school, it would be dark. You’d hear the coyotes and timber wolves howling and mother would be just terribly distraught and watching for the kids to finally get home. The last distance coming home was all uphill, so they didn’t hurry. They’d come slowly and mother would hear these timber wolves particularly–they ran in packs–would hear them howling and she would be so very worried that the kids were in trouble. However, they never seemed to bother them. I think they were more curious than anything else. I never heard of them attacking a human up there. Of course, if they did with those hillbillies, I don’t know whether they would have missed a kid or two or not.

On one occasion, my mother heard a screaming sound. And this was when I was home alone. The children were at school. She heard this screaming. She was just determined that somebody was in trouble. So she took me and walked out through the woods toward where the sound was coming from. Eventually we came into a little clearing and here was a cougar, switching its tail. I still remember that. That’s what had been doing the screaming. Well, my mother, holding my hand, headed back the way that we’d come and we were really fast. That was the sort of thing that happened up there.

I can remember my older brother going back through the woods to go to one of the logging camps to deliver some mail or something. He took our dog with him. It was two or three miles through the woods. On the way back one of these bands of timber wolves was ranging in there, so the dog led them away. This was a real smart animal. My brother came on home with no dog. The dog didn’t show up in a day or so, so finally my brother went back to the logging camp. The dog had gone back there and the sack or thing that my brother had carried was there by their stove. The dog was lying on that and he wouldn’t move and nobody could touch him. It was an interesting thing.

There’s, of course, talk about games and entertainment, this dog was part of our life up there. The sheep band had gone through, and a sheepherder–they were nearly all Basques and Spaniards. They had these trained dogs. They were very proud of them and very careful of their bloodlines. One of these dogs had crossed with a coyote and had then whelped this bunch of pups. They were going to kill them and dispose of them, but they gave this one dog to us. It was a legend in itself. It was just a wonderful dog and smart. I could see why the sheepherders developed a strain or line like that. We had him for years. He was just, well, he was just a part of the family. You talk about playing. We would go outside and we’d make a sound like a coyote and point down the hill. He’d join in the fun. He’d go rushing down the hill and then we’d all laugh and try to get away. He’d rush back to apprehend us before we could hide. I can remember I’d try to get up on a woodshed that had a low, sloping roof and if I didn’t make it, then he’d hold me down and if I would try to move he’d nip me. He was just as much a part of that game as we were.

**Mr. Frederick**: Let’s spend some time this morning talking with you about your mother. Once we get through that we’ll have an opportunity to go back to the childhood memories and play routines, games and whatnot. Physically describe your mother. How tall was she?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, in describing my mother, I always am somewhat amused when I think about it, because in most of my childhood in my mind, she was 10 feet tall. But she really wasn’t. She was actually a diminutive person. I suppose she was 5’6” or thereabouts and a very attractive person. Of her group of sisters I would say she was the most attractive one. I remember she had very long, golden blonde hair–not really very golden, kind of a corn silk thing.

I remember it so well because the little time that she would rest up in the place in the hills would usually be after the children had gone off to school and the two of us were left there alone or there might be a baby in a crib. She had a rocking chair and she would sit and quite often read her Bible or some of her church literature and I would brush her hair. She just loved that; and I would enjoy doing it. Well, I’ll never forget that she did have this beautiful hair. She enjoyed that and it provided her a few moments of relaxation.

At the same time the kitchen stove would be going and a boiler full of water would be heating. She might be boiling some clothes up in it, but, anyhow, her “idleness” was never completely idle. There was always something else going on.

It took me a long time to realize that she wasn’t a lot taller than she was, I suppose, because of the many things she did and the way she did them. She could break a horse or she could shoot a gun or she could sew to perfection. She had this sewing machine that hardly ever cooled off. And if you remember that type of sewing machine, it was operated with a foot treadle, went up and down, up and down. One of the precious things, of course, was sewing needles. She was forever running out of those and they had to be replaced. So that was one of the things that she seemed to be doing all the time.

Of course she did hand sewing. Like all such children at that time, particularly children of the Europeans, I think, she had learned to sew. She was forever making these crazy quilt blankets and later I can remember her weaving circular rugs. She’d make the fabric into sort of a rope and then she’d sew the ropes together into this little rug. That’s one of the things I remember her doing.

**Mr. Frederick**: And potentially that would be the only floor covering because the rugs would be washable?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, and we had–getting to floor coverings–we didn’t have such things. We weren’t concerned about them. These were little rugs that might be by a bed or something. But my mother would do the laundry, and incidentally, she often made our own laundry soap. And it was pretty powerful stuff. In boiling up this laundry the water wasn’t just dumped outside, it was used to scrub the floor.

That’s another thing she seemed to have a fetish about–cleanliness. The floors were just rough pine floors, but they were scrubbed white. And I can remember she’d use the soap suds and a broom and go over this. So she had a thing about cleanliness that was, oh, it was a part of her philosophy.

I can remember her at times saying, when we complained that we didn’t have the fancy clothes that we might want or we’d see some other kid having, that was not important. It was nice if you could have them; you couldn’t all have those things, but you could always be clean. And she impressed that. It was partially a defense on her part. She couldn’t provide the things that we were asking for, but she tried to give the logical substitute. And it was a good one, as I look back.

Then she was forever baking bread. That was one of the delights that I think is missed today. She was forever making bread and then she had some Norwegian recipes; I suppose that’s where she got them. She would make a very thin bread. She’d roll this bread dough to a paper thinness and then cook it on top of the stove, turn it once and it was done. Well, you could take that and roll it up and put some jelly in it, or butter if you had it, and it was delightful.

Another thing she always did was to make some dough cakes that were cooked in deep fat. I haven’t seen that sort of thing for years, but that was one of the things that she’d be doing. She made cinnamon rolls and a lot of delightful things that I think we could well use now, but there’s no way to get them. When you get them, they’re horrible things, made in the bakeries. Well, she sewed; she was forever doing laundry. And to do that laundry we all had to carry water about a block from a well. We used to always have a rain barrel, where you collected the rain that came down off the roof into a trough, and into the rain barrel. The prime reason for the rain barrel was to have some water ready in case you had a fire. If a house caught on fire you had an immediate source of water, but it was soft water and was also used for some things like laundry, and dishwashing or even cooking if it were fresh enough. But that was a standard facility.

**Mr. Frederick**: How did she express approval and affection?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, she was usually quite generous in praising your good works or good things that you did. She was a very loving person and affectionate. While she was, as I said, a stern disciplinarian, there was nothing mean about it. I can remember she used to send me out when I’d do something that displeased her; send me to cut a switch and she’d switch me with this thing. In later years I told her she logged the farm off up there that way.

But one time I thought I’d outfox her. I took the knife and I cut the switch almost in two and when she whacked me with it, it broke. Well, even she had to laugh at that and, anyway, that was one of her ways.

Another habit she had was if you said a dirty word she washed your mouth out with soap. The soap, some of it was homemade, was pretty potent, as I can personally attest. I can remember my rascal of a younger brother, Carl, who was always plotting mischief, one time asked if I could say some four-letter word and I did. He ran and told mother what I’d said. So she washes my mouth with soap. I got him later.

But trying to keep focused on my mother, she tried to enforce discipline as well as impart it logically. She didn’t put up with much nonsense, but you never felt that there was anything mean or vindictive involved in any way. It was just that you got what you had coming. So, like every kid, you did what you could get away with, and with her it was a game. She didn’t like to be outsmarted and wasn’t very often. Having been a child herself, she knew about what to expect.

**Mr. Frederick**: Considering the environment out there and the economic base that your mother was working from, what could she, outside of the family, claim as her own? Did she collect anything? Could she collect anything? Or what were her prized possessions out there?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, at first we had some of the fine things that were part of her wedding gifts and that sort of thing. She had some very fine dishes and silverware and quality things. They were not usual to the hill people, who were primitive and everything about them was primitive. But she did have these civilized things that were close and valuable to her.

That’s another tragic thing, in one of the interludes while we moved back into town for a winter or for a short period of time, mother, being the good person she was, let a destitute couple up there in the hills stay in our house while we were in the city. And this character held an auction and sold all of those things. So everybody in the hills had a dish or a kettle or a tray or some silverware that belonged to us. A little of it was recovered, but not much. That’s another tragic thing.

I can remember her also mentioning how children break things; you know, you have a few valuable or important possessions. She said that one by one they’d be broken or disappear; pretty soon they just were no more.

They had good friends and good family who had provided some nice things in the way of wedding gifts. Those were things that vanished and disappeared. And that is a severe blow to that type of person who is separated from the better things and from access to them. So you prize very highly the little mementos, things of value.

But that’s the tragedy, I think, of everybody in that situation and it certainly was true in her case.

When we acquired the property it was part of a homestead. We did not homestead the property. We had only one close neighbor and he had homesteaded the area. He sold off a couple of pieces of it.

**Mr. Frederick**: His name?

**Mr. Canwell**: His name was George Henricksen. He was a Dane, an interesting character in some ways. He had been a member of the Danish Royal Army. I think he had some problem over a girl and he took off for the States. He would come into Spokane and work to earn money to pay his homestead fee, to get coffee and staples that he had to have. So he would work in Spokane in the winter. He was here, I believe, when the Spokane Fire occurred, which was in 1889. So he must have acquired the homestead along about that time. He was a bachelor and remained one all of his life. Anyway, he was one of the more desirable hill folks up there. He had sufficient education, he was not an illiterate or that sort of thing. He had come here–as so many of them did–for some free land. There was homestead land available up in that area at that time.

Spokane, of course, was the jumping-off place in the West. It was quite a notorious town at that time. He came here like so many others, who then filtered out into these areas that could be homesteaded. The government had, in their railroad grants, given alternate sections to the railroads and the rest were up for homestead. That’s how most of these homesteads came about; that’s how this one came about.

And when we acquired it, it was a one-room house. It was built with pine boards. It was not clapboard, but rough pine boards that were approximately a foot wide and an inch thick. They were pitchy and lasted forever. Antique dealers have ripped most of them off from the old dwellings to sell. But that’s the type the house was. It had a pitched roof and chimney, no fireplace.

So when we came there my father built another room of similar size on it to the west, overlooking the edge of the hill and looking west toward Greenbluff. There’s about a three-mile valley in between. Well, he built that first, but as need arose we did what they did in the logging camps and other places; we built a base, a frame form, and put a tent over it. So we had two of those. Each one would accommodate a double bed and a stove.

The two of those were utilized most of the time we were there by the children–that is, the boys. My sister slept inside as my mother and father did and any infant children. Particularly the three boys, myself, and my two older brothers inhabited this space. My uncle who was killed occupied one of them.

It was quite comfortable, but very primitive. These

tents were not difficult to keep warm, had a little tin stove, little sheet metal stove, in them, and a very small amount of fuel would warm them. That’s about what I remember about those. They served the purpose of keeping the mosquitoes or bugs out and kept you warm and dry and were satisfactory. But that was part of the setup there.

Then there was a fairly large woodshed, which would have been maybe 30 feet to the north of the main house. Back of that was a Chick Sales Outdoor Plumbing facility. It was quite a walk from the house to that facility. Looking out that general direction there was a gate to the fencing that protected our garden and orchard area. Looking out that direction you look right at what is now called Mount Spokane. It was officially Mount Carlton at that time, and was generally called by the hill people “Old Baldy.” But that was our view to the north and I always enjoyed it.

We had a chicken house that was to the east and we had a root cellar. It was customary there, you dug a root cellar; you built the walls up with rocks and then put a roof over it that was covered with dirt, which would last a number of years before the ceiling logs would rot out and have to be replaced. It was a very efficient thing. It would keep potatoes, squash, cabbage, rutabagas and things like that, and some apples, all winter. So we were not too deprived ever. We had the things that made for good stews and we were able to raise and preserve them.

That’s another thing my mother was forever doing, canning fruit. We always had whatever fruit was available canned, and in considerable quantity. I remember another task that was part of this living there; that the room that my father built on the house had not a flat roof, but it was not a very steep pitch. My mother would dry fruit on that: prunes, yellow transparent apples, and something we always had was dried fruit. These dried apples, we’d take a pocket full of them with us to munch on the way to school and back.

Ah, I think I mentioned, maybe not in recorded session, that one year we went up in the hills and got huckleberries. They were canned in great quantity. Strawberries we raised, we had strawberry jam. And, oh, of course, always had onions and some garlic. We didn’t use much of that, but we had it. And all in all, we were able to come up with a pretty tasty and satisfactory meal.

Another interesting thing I might say about my mother, she was a lifelong vegetarian. I don’t ever remember her eating a bite of meat of any kind, but somehow or another she knew how to cook it in the most tasty and delightful ways. She could even make venison edible, and that takes a bit of doing.

Everybody in the hills raised some pigs except the Canwells. My mother, being an Adventist, wouldn’t touch the stuff. She didn’t think it was fit to eat and wouldn’t even use the bacon, or get the benefit of bacon greases. She put together very delightful food, but that wasn’t one of the staples.

For meat, we had more pheasants and game birds and fish. We had fish from the little stream down there. It was called Dead Man Creek. I don’t know what it is now. I think they changed the name. It runs up to the foot of Mount Spokane, originates there.

It’s another thing my mother did to perfection. She loved to fish and she was a very patient person. She would find that there was a good-sized trout in some pool and it was a game with her. She’d stay at it until she got him. With me, I was more like the Indians and others up there, I’d fish up and down a stream. But she would zero in on them and, as a manifestation of her inherent patience, she got the fish.

But we had fish. We had wild game. We had garden produce. An important factor there was cabbage. The cabbage kept well and it will season most everything in the way of a stew or roast, or a boiled dinner. That and rutabagas were very essential. We had them and she knew how to use them. When we had venison, in the cold weather it would be hanging outside. You didn’t have refrigeration, so usually it was consumed quite rapidly. The bones and inedible part went to the dogs.

Another thing I remember about the venison, my mother would make mince pie. The old pioneer way of making it required venison. She would cook up this leg of venison, pick it off in little pieces and that went into the mince pie. She would put currants in it and various other things. And hard cider if we had it. Then in cold weather she’d put those out and let them freeze. It was a delightful product and I don’t know whether anybody does it that way now, but that became a mince pie.

Oh, yes, we never had pumpkin pie as such. She always made her pumpkin pie out of squash, which makes a superior pie and the squashes would keep. These Hubbard squashes are almost indestructible and they’d last all winter, but they’re delightful food. She would can up some of that sort of thing and use it for pies.

We had one German neighbor who was probably half a mile or so away, but whose house and dwelling was not within our line of vision. He had been a butcher, I believe, in Germany. He used to sell beef products and whatever in town. He’d drive into Hillyard, which is a suburb of Spokane. He would go in about once a week with something to sell.

Whatever money he got he’d take to the local pub and the bartenders and people there knew him. When it was time for him to go home, they’d unhitch his team from where it was tied at the rack, tie the lines up, put him in the front seat and point him toward Mount Spokane. He didn’t need a designated driver; these horses would come home with this drunk.

Well, that was a routine for this character–he was not a very affable person–cultivated nobody’s company. My dad couldn’t stand him and so they had no contact with each other at all. But he did sell beef and, I think, would buy some of this from other hill people and would butcher it and take it in. He’d make sausage or different things and it was a source of income for him.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did your mother ever can venison or beef?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, she would can the venison tongues and hearts. And I think, pickle them, some sort of pickling process. We did dry some venison, made jerky out of it. It’s an inedible thing, but it’s something that would sustain life if you had to eat it. We didn’t go in much for that. As I told you before, my father was a crack shot. There were not many deer up there in those days because the deer thrive on underbrush and that type of browsing. When the timber was there, there wasn’t much brush and not much forage for them, so there were many fewer deer than there are now.

He would go out and get a deer every now and then, so that was a source of meat. Believe me, venison is not a very desirable source of meat. It’s a little better nowadays where they pasture in better forage. But that was one of the things we had.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did you ever see any elk up there?

**Mr. Canwell**: In those days, no. I understand they do now; that there are elk and even a moose wandered into Spokane the other day. When we were up there, I’m certain there were no elk and no moose. There were bear and the hill people ate bear. That’s another thing that neither my father nor mother would eat, so we never took advantage of that. We did, as I say, get game birds or blue grouse and fool hens or pheasants.

Some of the hill people there, one or two families, were part Indian and they hunted like Indians. They would build a stand up in a tree near a water hole and wait until the deer came down for water and they’d pick them off. One of these families particularly, the Parkers, always had five or six deer hanging up out in their shed. They’d eat the edible parts and give the rest to their dogs. Their dogs were of such a variety you would not have wanted to come within a half-mile of the place anyway. Talk about a junkyard dog, they really had them. The family were not very sociable people, they didn’t mix very well. Two families of them were early pioneer homesteaders up in that area.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was in the orchard?

**Mr. Canwell**: We had a great variety of fruit. The trees included quite a number and variety of apples. One of the principal ones was Wagner. That was because they were a very good keeper; a dry land Wagner will keep all year. Then there were quite a number of yellow transparents. They produced a good applesauce and dried apples.

There were cherries, apricots. I don’t remember that there were any peach trees or if there were they didn’t survive. There was a Grimes Golden, I think they are an apple that they crossed to make the Golden Delicious, but they were like a Golden Delicious only smaller. Then there were some of the native, or almost native, apples. The earliest apples up there were King apples, a very attractive shapely, quite large apple, but not much for eating. When we got better trees developed, we abandoned those or didn’t use them.

We had enough apples to make some cider and that was a handmade thing. You cut these up, crushed them and had a turning apparatus with a handle on it that you used to squeeze the apple juice, which ran down a little chute into your bucket. That was one of the byproducts of the orchard. We did have cherry trees. There were pie cherry trees, I remember two or three trees were Bing cherries.

We had a quince tree. Now when commercial pectins are available, that no longer is significant, but that was what you used for pectin to thicken your jellies and things; so everybody who knew what he was doing had a quince tree. Crab apples, we had two or three crab apple trees. They also were more or less used for the same purpose, to get the substance to jell because of the acid in them.

Oh, there were pear trees, too. In general it was a very well-balanced orchard that became a delight to the few deer that were there. So then it became necessary for my father to fence this orchard in with an 8 foot chicken wire fence. It was only the most desperate deer who could clear the 8 foot fence, but anything less than that they’d come in and prune your trees whenever the browsing was short anywhere else. In fact, they do it out at my farm now.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did your father use pine for his fence posts?

**Mr. Canwell**: We used fir and tamarack. The pine is–if you have the choice–the pine is too soft; the fir is a little better; tamarack is excellent and splits quite well. So it seems to me that most of our fence posts, at least for the chicken wire fencing and things, were tamarack. That was available because the logging operation had no interest in it. The tamaracks would die and dry. They were standing there curing and maturing and they were always available, very hard on your saw and axe, but almost indestructible. They did split quite well. So that, as I recall, was the choice or favorite fence post.

Originally there wasn’t much fencing up there. There wasn’t any occasion to fence it. Later years there were more cattle running loose, so you had to fence them out. But originally it was just more a matter of marking your boundary lines, having a fence.

Oh, another thing we had was grapes. We didn’t have the grapevines, but old Henricksen, the Dane, had planted a bunch of them very early. I don’t know what they were called. I imagine they’d make wonderful wine. They were little red grapes that were quite sweet.

I remember the Dane had a wonderful apricot tree down near the well. It was a very prolific thing and it was very difficult to keep out of that, because the fruit was so attractive and desirable but, if you touched it, it infuriated the owner, so we didn’t bother it much.

**Mr. Frederick**: And you had no plum trees?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, there were some plums and Italian prunes and I think there was what was called a “petite plum,” a sweet plum or a prune. I don’t remember any large plums and still I think we did have. I know the neighbor had a tree with larger plums on it.

Most of the stuff he had they didn’t do anything with. He always had a nice garden, but raised much more than he could use. There was no place to sell it. He’d give it away if anybody wanted it, but most of the hill folks were too lazy to go get anything that was free, unless it was something they wanted to steal; that was a different matter.

**Mr. Frederick**: How did you contain the milk cow?

**Mr. Canwell**: We had a certain amount of fencing. More often we just let her run out. They come back; normally they’ll come back for feeding and milking time. Occasionally they would not, so you had to go find her, but we didn’t particularly try to confine the cow because there was no forage in the cleared area but considerable out in the forest area.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did she wear a bell?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, everybody belled their cows. You could tell your own bell. You could hear it a long distance away, so you’d know where old Bossy was. That was another chore that as children we had, to go bring the critter in. I never milked the cow, but I know at least one of my brothers used to do that. Mother did, she kind of liked to.

Anyway that was an important source of food. We had our butter and cottage cheese. My mother was forever making cottage cheese. She’d let the milk sour and clabber. She’d warm it on the back of the stove until the curd came together, and then she would put it in one of these flour sacks; you twist it and work the whey out of it. And then you had cottage cheese. She would make it up sometimes in large curds, sometimes small curds. If you ate the stuff, it was very good with some good thick cream on it and I can remember doing that. My mother was forever trying to make people drink milk. One of my brothers, John, would not touch it.

It required a lot of endeavor to keep this cow corralled and fed. We fed them grain additives, shorts and bran, and that was one of the expensive commodities you had to have. It had to be bought from the store.

When we had horses or a team, of course, it was no big problem, you go down there and get your groceries and shorts and bran. And it seemed to me we’d occasionally buy some baled alfalfa, but more often we had enough of that up there. The neighbor always had a cow or two and he raised enough alfalfa that he had extra.

He also raised some wheat, which he’d thresh by hand. That was harvested, I suppose, the way they did for centuries. He had a scythe. He’d go out and cut this stuff, had a cradle on it. Then he’d wrap up pieces of the straw and tie it around the bundle. He’d put these bundles in a shock and let them dry. Then he would haul them in and pitch them into the barn. We did the same thing, except we didn’t have much land for hay, but we did help him put his up.

He would get his wheat or grain for his chickens from what filtered down from these shocks of wheat that were pitched in the barn and then some of it that he might flail, letting the wind blow the chaff away. So he’d have sacks of wheat for feeding his chickens. Very primitive, but it worked.

My father built a chicken house down there and surrounded the chicken yard with chicken wire to keep the coyotes out. But we didn’t have a large flock of 12 or 15 chickens. We just had enough to produce some eggs. Of course, we’d raise the roosters to eat. And we hatched our own chicks. We had an incubator, which was a very advanced thing up there in those days. That was kept warm with a kerosene lamp. We’d hatch these chickens and there were often more from the hens; when they got to setting they want to set on and hatch eggs themselves. And so there would be some of them that would produce that way, but to make sure of a brood, we also used the incubator. You usually kept one or two virile roosters for breeding purposes.

I remember one particular incident having to do with our Danish neighbor and his chickens. When he would plow, he’d go out there plowing around this area and, of course, turning up worms and things. He’d let his chickens out there to go along and they’d feed on the worms. I was sitting on a stump watching this operation one day. A coyote came up from the other direction and sat there awhile watching the operation. This Dane was a very nervous character. He was so nervous that he made his horses nervous. There was always a danger of their bolting and running away. And they did that quite often.

They’d bust up all of his equipment.

Well, anyway, he’d go along, “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa–” and a coyote was sitting up there watching the operation. I was watching it from another position. His chickens were out there in the plowed ground. And this coyote just carefully wended his way up there, keeping his eye on the plowman. Finally he grabbed one of the roosters, just grabbed him and away he went looking back at the farmer, but the farmer not daring to say anything, in fear that he’d spook his horses. Well, that was a way of life there.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was his first name?

**Mr. Canwell**: George. Once a year he’d go in and serve on the jury. That was a way of getting a little money for staples, and his tax money. I don’t know whether you want that here or not. But it was one of the things that influenced my thinking.

One time there was a train robbery out here at Hillyard or north of Hillyard. A young fellow, a foolish guy, held up the train. So George Henricksen was called for jury duty when this young man was being tried. I remember his saying when he came back, “I didn’t listen to the testimony. I knew he was guilty when I first saw him.”

Well, that’s kind of what you get in a jury, and you still get it. Henricksen was a study in himself, nervous, I won’t say a nervous wreck, because he was very healthy, but he had this excitable side. My dad kept away from him because he didn’t want to have to clobber him. He couldn’t tolerate his nervous disposition.

My mother sort of liked the guy, largely because when coming into town to work in the winter he had become acquainted with her church people and had joined the church. So they had that much compatibility. Being a Dane he didn’t read the English language and he got his Adventist papers in the Danish language, so she couldn’t read them. That was part of explaining him. But he was in many ways a delightful person, too.

I can remember I was just at the right age to find it interesting to go over to his place. Sometimes he was making hotcakes and I’d get one of them. He had a phonograph that nobody around there had in those days. He had some records and would play that. It seemed to me it was a disk thing, but it was very ancient.

**Mr. Frederick**: That must have been absolutely magical for you as a young child.

**Mr. Canwell**: It was pretty far back. Then, I don’t know just what time, I remember his having this music machine. He had two or three catalog pictures on the wall that just fascinated me. I know why now, because they were Charlie Russell paintings that the hardware store put out in their calendar. So there’s one of my first recollections of this artwork of Charlie Russell. I was just fascinated with it. I’d have given anything to take those things home.

**Mr. Frederick**: Do you remember which scenes he had hanging up there?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, I remember one of them very well. It was a man on a horse and it seemed to be a packhorse. A bear was confronting them and the horse was bolting. It’s still one of the famous Russell paintings. There were three Charlie Russell prints from the Hillyard Hardware.

**Mr. Frederick**: Let’s take the opportunity to describe your house and furnishings at the home on Mount Spokane.

**Mr. Canwell**: The house that we acquired when we went there in 1909 was a one room house, I would guess it might have been 16’ by 25’ or 30’. It had a stove and a chimney up through the roof in the center of the room. There was an attic in which things could be stored, it was not large enough to stand up in but there were things stored there.

The arrangement of the house at that time was very inadequate. There were at least two beds in the south end of the room. There was a kitchen table and chairs, I’d say five or six chairs. There was one rocking chair. This is the chair where, the few opportunities she had to rest, my mother would sit and read whatever she had to read, usually her Bible.

The furniture was very inadequate. Besides the chairs, there were homemade benches that served for seating at the table along with the chairs. There also was a bench outside that had a water bucket and hand-washing pan and a dish for soap and that was on the outside. There was a china cabinet.

**Mr. Canwell**: I remember how the wind would howl around the corners of the house in the wintertime. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in Switzerland, they have about a month when the wind blows and it howls; they call it the “bees.” Well, that’s about what was happening there.

Our house was up on top of a hill and right at the edge of it, and it seemed to get that breeze.

In the kitchen area there was a door to the outside and there was a gun rack above the door. My father’s rifle and a .22 caliber rifle were there.

Then we had a kitchen table where we ate and there were several of these benches around for seating. There was always a tea kettle on the stove steaming and some-times a coffee pot. While my mother didn’t believe in drinking coffee, she was still a Norwegian. So that was one of her occasional vices, she’d have a sip of coffee now and then.

Some hooks were fastened in the wall and curtains curtained off the sleeping area. Then things moved so fast, my brother Carl was born up there; in fact three of the boys were, Carl and John and Joe.

Then it became immediately necessary to expand the space and then this room was actually put up and tents acquired. I don’t remember exactly when Aaron came up there, but it was very early.

I don’t ever remember many candles, but we always had kerosene lamps and lanterns. More often than not they used the lanterns because if you had to go out to the outhouse or you had to go feed cattle or something you carried the lanterns along. They were a very convenient thing.

**Mr . Canwell**: I don’t remember entirely what was there at first. You see, a family had occupied this house. They had bought the property from Henricksen and then I think they sold to my father. At that time there was at least one giant fir tree out here. I’ll always remember it because like most of the pioneers they weren’t interested in scenery, they saw the utility of things.

My father cut this tree down and, of course, we burned it for fuel and then the stump was in the way. So at various times he’d dig around this stump to get it out of there and finally he decided to blast it. I will never forget that, because a piece of the stump came through the window. He wasn’t as expert with dynamite as he was with his gun, but anyhow we got rid of the stump. That was a disaster, because you had to go a long ways to get glass.

**Mr. Frederick**: I cannot imagine that she would pleased with that whole operation.

**Mr. Canwell**: No, my mother wasn’t exactly a nag, but sometimes she would chastise my father for doing something when she thought he obviously should have known better. I remember that she would criticize the flatness of the roof on the addition, but it had a very logical explanation. He just couldn’t get the long 2-by-4s and he didn’t

have enough of them to splice and do it. He had to get the roof on and he did it, so his only defense against my district attorney mother was that he would start to swear. He had some really choice language that he had learned in the military and that would shut my mother up. She would get away; she didn’t like that. And so, anyway, she was a little inclined to remind him of things like blasting the stump or building a roof that was too flat.

**Mr. Frederick**: So every once in awhile she would strategically remind him about that roof and apparently he had heard about that roof several times previously?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, yeah, quite a number of times. Anyhow, it wasn’t a disaster. It served as a wonderful area for drying fruit and was utilized for that, but it did require recovering more often than a shingle roof would or a shake. The main room had a pitched roof with native cedar shakes on it. This was covered with tar paper, which was commonly used and was not indestructible when we walked up there as much as we did and took fruit and things up there. It had to be replaced or patched and repaired more often than the shake roof would.

**Mr. Frederick**: Were there any wall hangings or any calendars in those two rooms?

**Mr. Canwell**: Wherever we could, we would acquire a calendar, and usually they came from town or we brought them out there. There were a few pictures, one of them was a large photograph of my grandmother and father and his twin sister. That, I think, was out there for awhile and then taken back into town so it survived. There were other pictures, but not a great many, mostly in the form of calendars. They were highly prized because you needed them and then they were ornamental.

I remember a gun rack and the rifles on the rack. Usually there would be a double-bitted axe or two because they had to be sharpened all the time. On rainy days or something, my father particularly might be sharpening the axe or grinding it down. And he had good facilities for cleaning, keeping his guns clean and oiled.

Another thing he had was a small mirror, a stand, and a basin where he shaved. I can remember this razor strop. It was two or three pieces of leather, one side was coarser than the other for keeping his razor sharp.

**Mr. Canwell**: The razor strop hung on a nail on the wall. It was used as a constant threat as a behavioral instrument. I never remember his laying it on anybody, but we always understood that he would. A time or two I can remember my mother getting it and taking after one of us, but any-way that was an important instrument.

Another thing he had was a fine set of barber tools. We were probably the only kids in the hills who had a decent haircut. He had these barber scissors and was very touchy about that. He wouldn’t even let my mother use them in her sewing operation.

**Mr. Frederick**: Were you proud of the haircuts you received from your father?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, yes, it was so different than these kids at school and that was a sight in itself. Some of them looked like they’d just put a bowl or a kettle down over their head and cut around the edges. Their haircuts were horrible, mutilation jobs, and as I remember most of the children, they weren’t very clean or well washed.

The girls seemed to take a little more pride in their braided hair and I suppose it was a little easier problem to solve.

**Mr. Frederick**: You can remember some of your siblings’ births?

**Mr. Canwell**: I remember Carl’s birth that occurred right after we went up there. I was very small and I don’t remember as much about that but I remember his infancy. I remember because he had a painful problem and was doing a lot of crying. My father and mother decided he needed to be circumcised. And I can remember my mother holding him while my father did this circumcision on him. He was hollering like hell.

**Mr. Frederick**: Was this your mother’s idea?

**Mr. Canwell**: Probably so. She was a trained nurse and my father had medical training. So it was something that they felt obviously needed to be done. The medications they had at that time were very limited, very primitive. They didn’t have the anesthetics and things that would have been desirable, so they just had to do it the way it could be done.

**Mr. Frederick**: Was Carl the only one that had to undergo that procedure?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, he’s the only one that I recall.

**Mr. Frederick**: It’s a wonder he didn’t die of infection out there.

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, they did have some disinfectants. I think they had alcohol.

**Mr. Frederick**: Well, you were quite young at that age. Did you think that maybe they were doing away with your little brother?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, I was very aware that he didn’t like what was happening, that’s about all I remember. Anyway, he survived it. He had some irritation there that had to be attended to and that seemed to be the obvious thing to do. Both my mother and father were competent to have performed the procedure. They had enough medical training and a knowledge of proper procedures and cleanliness and sterilizing things. But I recall her cradling him and holding him. I was very small. It was right after we first went up there.

I remember better the birth of my brother, John. My father had built a big fire in a stump down over the hill and we sat around there and kept warm by the fire while the birth was taking place. But no doctor. It was Carl, John, and Joe my father delivered, and helped my mother make the deliveries. That was typical of that kind of life. I don’t suppose that anybody up there in the hills ever had a doctor for a birthing.

**Mr. Frederick**: Were there storage boxes under those beds?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, I believe that there were. There was always stuff stuffed under the bed. You didn’t have adequate storage facilities, but didn’t have a lot to store. We did have tools and things. I rather think that’s where my mother stored any of my things that weren’t in trunks.

There were facilities that were native to time, pots that were kept under beds so that people who couldn’t or didn’t wish to go out in the night to the outhouse could use the facility indoors. But it wasn’t a recommended practice, usually you were expected to make it back to the little outhouse. I remember vividly some such instances and I didn’t like it. It was a long ways in the cold weather. People talk about the good old days–they don’t appreciate indoor plumbing.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was that little village called by the store?

**Mr. Canwell**: It was just called the Peone Store. The school was the Beaver Creek School. It was across the road from the store. Down to the east about a quarter of a mile was a sawmill. The people who had the sawmill were sort of aristocrats because they had a little more money than other people. They were still hillbillies; they just had more shoes or something. But they did provide lumber. It was available and anybody who could buy it or trade logs for it could get lumber to frame up a house.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was the source of power for that sawmill?

**Mr. Canwell**: I believe originally it was a water wheel that wasn’t very effective. And then they had steam, I believe. They had a donkey engine or something that operated this steam device that ran a pulley, and cut the logs.

**Mr. Frederick**: And that would have been wood-fired? 

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes.

**Mr. Frederick**: Describe that country store.

**Mr. Canwell**: The store was typical of grocery stores at that time and particularly in a remote area like that. They had flour and salt and cornmeal and such things. Then they had barrels of crackers and other commodities sitting out in the open. You’d go fish out what you wanted to buy and take it up and they’d weigh it. Then there was a counter in back of that shelving. There was tobacco back there and canned milk–that was a staple in those days. When we didn’t have a cow, we bought condensed milk. There was quite a market for that there. It was not expensive.

In front of the store across the road was a rack of mailboxes. Everybody in the hills had a mailbox there; no mail delivery beyond that point. The mail came out from Hillyard or Mead by horse-and-buggy or wagon.

I remember the first automobile that came up there came to the store to deliver mail. I was in my first year of school there. They let the school out for the kids to go out and see the car. It was one of those early-day Fords with a brass radiator and straps down to the fenders from the top. That impressed me greatly because that was the first one as far as anybody knows to penetrate that far into the backwoods area.

But at the store itself, you could buy kerosene in cans and you could either bring your gallon can and have it filled or you could buy case lots of it. They did sell two five-gallon square cans that fitted into a wooden case and you could buy them in that quantity. But most people would come with their gallon can and have it filled because that’s what they used for their lamps; they had no other real use for it.

I’m trying to think what else was at the store. The woman would sell you stamps. And there was a telephone. The telephone connected with Mead, Hillyard, and Spokane and it was a party-line affair. I remember the woman who ran the store; if there was an emergency call she’d crank this phone up for you and place the call. She would then call the people all along the line and say, “Get off the line, Mrs. So-and-so. It’s an emergency call.” All of these listeners would automatically tune in whenever there was a call, but she’d have to get them all off so you could be heard. The telephone line ended at the Peone Store. In those days there were no telephones beyond that point.

**Mr. Frederick**: And her name?

**Mr. Canwell**: The name was Roberts, I believe, a Mrs. Roberts, it was a man and wife operation, but she was usually the attendant.

Other things they had there, they had tobacco and snuff. Quite a lot of the lumberjacks used this Copenhagen snuff–deadly stuff. And there was canned tobacco. I always suspected at first that that’s where my father got my name because he smoked Prince Albert. I found out later that it was a family name.

**Mr. Frederick**: Then did he roll cigarettes or smoke a pipe?

**Mr. Canwell**: He smoked a pipe. I don’t ever remember his rolling cigarettes. And one of his luxuries was a can of tobacco once in awhile. I don’t remember what else might have been available at the store.

**Mr. Frederick**: Cloth?

**Mr. Canwell**: Cloth? There was oilcloth. Maybe you’re familiar with that.

**Mr. Canwell**: They had rows or a rack of tablecloths. It seemed to me there was a choice of two different colors, you could get a red one or a blue one–blue check or red check. That was one of the things we had that covered the kitchen table. I’d forgotten about it.

**Mr. Frederick**: Could you get a newspaper in there?

**Mr. Canwell**: For years we took the Spokane Chronicle. That’s one of the things we did when we came from school. I’d bring the mail or my brothers or sister would bring the mail home and the paper would be in that. A little later on, the First World War was shaping up and I can remember those great big headlines on the front page of the Chronicle. We were almost unique in taking a newspaper up there. I suppose most of the local people could read, but they weren’t interested.

**Mr. Frederick**: Was there a catalog in that house?

**Mr. Canwell**: A catalog? That was a staple in everybody’s house and outhouse. We had the Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog and there was another one from Montgomery Ward and Co. Everybody got these catalogs, they called them “wish books.” It was always a source of interest to thumb through these catalogs to see what was out there in the real world.

**Mr. Frederick**: That must have been the most magic book in the house for you.

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, it really was to everybody, I think. They were large and very elaborate and illustrated. They were just a source of wonder.

Occasionally my parents would order something that they needed. Quite often it would be something like a curry comb for the horses or some other article that you needed and didn’t have. You could get blankets, saddles, just about everything, most of which you couldn’t afford anyway, but it was wonderful to know it was there.

We figured out some ways of making a few dollars once in awhile, picking fruit. We once got an assignment to gather sweet clover seed. It grew all along the logging railroad. I suppose the seeds had fallen off the train and took root along the railroad tracks. The seed to sweet clover was quite valuable, so somebody made a deal with us to gather a bag of it, a large bag. Nobody had realized how long and how much effort it takes to fill one of those big bags with sweet clover seed. But we gathered it and I remember we got twelve dollars, which was a fortune for this great big bag of sweet clover seed.

I’m deviating from what you wanted at the country store. You could get nails down there and that was an important commodity. They had eight-and ten penny nails and shingle nails. They had roofing tacks that you tack the tar paper roofs down with. You could buy metal files there and rasps. But there was a very limited supply of that sort of thing.

**Mr. Frederick**: You mentioned that the logging company accessed the area out there via railroad. Was that private?

**Mr. Canwell**: The railroad land was a railroad grant. There were railroad grants given to the railroads to induce them to build the railroads through the country and through the West and that was part of the deal. I don’t know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, but it got the railroads built and the railroads–at least up in our area–owned alternate sections. I think that was true clear across the country, that they were given these land grants to aid and abet them in developing the railroads.

Up there the railroad sold off trees to the early-day lumbermen, who were in general an unscrupulous lot. And they surveyed. They knew where their lines were, but they forgot them when they got to cutting the timber. So anybody who had a section adjoining one of those railroad sections usually had his best trees looted and hauled away. If he made a fuss about it, he might get shot or beaten up or whatever was necessary. They made a lot of money; some of them became Spokane millionaires and that was the story up there.

The hill folks didn’t understand laws or much of anything else and were afraid of the law in most cases. If they weren’t so afraid of the law and called for help, which wouldn’t have been forthcoming anyway, then they were afraid of the goons that the timber barons had. It was a rough and ruthless thing; the sort of thing that made radicals of loggers and other people, but it was part of the history of our time.

**Mr. Frederick**: What railroad company put the line through up there?

**Mr. Canwell**: It might have been the Great Northern, I just at this point don’t know. I don’t think they were original builders, I think the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific were two of the original railroad builders.

They built these railroads across the country in many cases with Chinese labor. Those railroad men were a hard-driving group, some of them were recognized as great men afterwards. Hillyard, a suburb of Spokane, is named for Jim Hill, who put the railroads through this area. There were a lot of things he contributed to the area, but most of it was the railroad.

**Mr. Frederick**: The reason I ask is, if there needed to be an order placed through that store and you said, “Take a team into Hillyard or Mead to pick up that shipment,” would that shipment come out of Spokane via a railroad or via team and horses?

**Mr. Canwell**: If it were ordered from Sears Roebuck or Montgomery Ward, it would come by railroad to Spokane. Then it would be optional whether you shipped it by rail up to Mead. The railroad went through Mead and another little town north of there; either place you could pick things up, but Mead was the better road and a more direct way to town. For shipments like that it was quite likely that they would be picked up at Mead and that was, say, 12 miles from our place. You could get things sent up through some approach to the logging operations, but it was not too satisfactory. You would have to arrange that yourself.

**Mr. Frederick**: You would have to know someone in the operation?

**Mr. Canwell**: In general, and somebody who would do it and someone you could trust. Usually it was handled the other way because there were quite a lot of things that had to be picked up that way. Various ones of the hill people would go together in hauling things.

**Mr. Frederick**: That was my next question. Was there an individual who made a living doing that? Or was each family responsible for trucking to Mead to make those pickups.

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, in early times there was someone who ran almost a bus service up to the logging camps. So if you utilized that, as we did when my mother and I first made the trip up to the farm after we had acquired it, you rode out on this facility to where we got off the main road and then walked up a mile or so to our house.

**Mr. Frederick**: Was that a team and horses?

**Mr. Canwell**: It was horses and it was, as I recall the thing, sort of a bus. They hauled the lumberjacks up there and it was transportation for the bosses and others who would go into town. Some of the people who lived up there in the hills would utilize this and there probably was some pay system, but I don’t remember what it was.

**Mr. Frederick**: Well, considering your age, when you first accessed that, it must have been a very mysterious, romantic adventure.

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, it was a dramatic thing. I must have been–I think it was along in October in the fall and I was born in January, so I would have been three on my next birthday. I’ve always been surprised at how much I remembered of it. But I do recall riding up on that rig and getting off there. My mother had a suitcase and some other things. I was just a toddler and remember walking up that road and around on up to our place. It was quite a long walk, carrying things.

I described earlier how I still remember the beauty of these tamarack trees that had turned yellow. They were like candles in a green forest. I remember seeing those all along the way; none of that had been cut. There was a certain amount of brush and weed along the road, but not much. Buckbrush and other stuff grew after the timber was logged off the first time.

**Mr. Frederick**: When they came through and logged that the first time and you had the opportunity to watch that, how many years did it take for something to grow back?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, of course, they didn’t cut small trees, the second growth timber was left standing. They went after the big trees and valuable stuff. There was no market for these pencil trees that they market now. They left quite a lot, but also left a lot of slashings.

These trees were lopped down and cut up into log lengths and then skidded by horses down to the landing level. They had a logging railroad in those days they’d constructed in there. All they had to do was to get logs down off the hills, down to this creek basin, and then they had great stacks of them. Those stacks were loaded onto rail cars and taken over to Elk, which was another little town along the railroad, a little farther north. They did have a good store and commissary facilities at Elk. Once in awhile we’d go over there or my brothers would ride the logging train over there.

They had a game they used to play. This famous dog of ours, Nig, they’d take along on this trip to Elk and someone on the train would want to buy him, so they’d sell him to them. And, of course, when the train got to Elk and the kids headed home, the dog was right behind them. So it became a kind of joke among the railroad people or the logging people, the Canwell kids selling this dog, because they wouldn’t have sold him for a million dollars. And they knew he’d come back and he did every time. But that was another means, while the logging railroad was in there, by which we could get to Mead or to Elk, so that was done occasionally.

**Mr. Frederick**: What type of locomotives did they use on that road?

**Mr. Canwell**: They had steam locomotives. They were not large, but they seemed large to me at the time. It wasn’t a narrow gauge railroad either, it was a wider standard gauge, probably because these flatcars loaded with logs were so heavy that it required a good bed. They did a pretty good job of building that railroad there and as soon as they were through logging they ripped it up and took the rails away.

But it was a source of interest. From up at our place on the hill, I could see this train go chugging along. They had a whistle on it that when they had a notion, or a cow or deer got on the track, they’d blow this whistle and you could hear that way up where we were. But it was a source of interest. We kids watched the train go by; there was action in a place where there was very little except the normal sounds of life.

At a later point I think probably we should go into something about this railroad and Elk and a notorious woman who lived along the railroad.

**Mr. Frederick**: Albert, why don’t you do that now?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, this was an interesting thing because this Molly Gilchrist had been a Spokane prostitute. As I got the story, she married a man who owned some property up there. He staked her out up there to get her out of town, but he was not there. He had a feed store or something in Spokane and left her up there in the hills. She became a very notorious character. When the logging train would go by, she’d purposefully be out working in her little garden right nearby. She would wave at the loggers and pretty soon they developed a habit of stopping off to see Molly. She usually had a bottle there and they could play cards or other things as long as they had money. She would accumulate these silver dollars and she had a lot of them. She buried them out along by her barn and woodshed.

Molly had a hired man who was a kind of simple soul, but not as simple as she thought. She’d send him to Elk to get a bottle of booze for the guests. He had watched her burying her money, so he helped himself to it, got himself a bottle in town and came back thoroughly soused. So Molly was about to do him in. She took after him with a pitchfork. He ran around a haystack with Molly after him, with her long Mother Hubbard skirt flying, and every time she’d make a jab at him, he’d muster another spurt of energy. He was going around and around and would let out a war hoop as he ran.

My mother was out looking for our cattle; she had followed them on horseback and she rode into this incident as it was happening. Molly, of course, stopped this procedure and was just so thankful to my mother. She said, “If you hadn’t come along, I’d have killed the little SOB.”

And anyhow that was Molly. She was a notorious character and as smart as could be. She knew how to make money with the one facility she had. And she benefited, of course, by the logging activity up there. She is a legend in the hills.

She had a son up there, Walter Gilchrist and, like so many hillbillies, he was a dead-eye shot. About all he did was hunt and shoot, except that he had an instinct for mechanical things. He could build a sawmill or anything else. But they drafted him in the war \[World War I\] and he became a sort of a Sergeant York in the war because of his shooting ability. He then came back to the hills and married a woman just like his mother.

The hill country up there is full of that kind of story.

They shouldn’t all be forgotten because those people were colorful and sometimes dramatic and Molly was one of the most colorful. She lived right by the logging railroad that hauled the logs into Elk where most were then transported to mills in Spokane or elsewhere by rail.

**Mr. Frederick**: What were those logging camps called and how many were there?

**Mr. Canwell**: There were two or three of them in along Dead Man Creek, which is our area. One or two of the outfits were operated by the Edwards and Bradford Lumber Company. That one I remember and there were others. I think the Dimeling family were interested in logging up there and they became prominent Spokane people. Also the Edwards and Bradford, I think, was the big company that first went in there with large equipment and did a big job.

**Mr. Frederick**: At that age in 1913, 1914, did you ever have an opportunity to walk through one of those camps?

**Mr. Canwell**: I used to go down to one of them that was just down the hill to the north from our place. There was a trail down the side of the mountain that you could use to get to this logging camp. Since for a time my father worked there as an assistant to the blacksmith, I would go down there to see him. I remember the chef down there at their eating place would always give me something special to eat, so I used every excuse I could to get down there.

There were tents and cabins, largely tents. That’s where we got the tent idea and basis for the ones we installed up at our farm. But that’s where the lumberjacks lived; they lived largely in the tents. The cook’s shack, dining hall, and commissary were built out of rough lumber and very crude, but served the purpose. They had their big cookstoves and water tanks in there, and eating tables.

The food was generally good. That’s one thing they did; they didn’t pay too well, but they fed well. I did quite often go down there.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was the capacity of those tents in that camp?

**Mr. Canwell**: The dining capacity, I suppose, would accommodate approximately 30 people who would have seating at one time. There were long tables and benches. The dining room was very close to the cooking facilities. Food was cooked in great big pots and kettles and ladled out in bowls and dishes. As I say I think they were pretty well fed. I don’t remember the cook too well there, I remember the blacksmith, whose name was Bill Bailey; I don’t know why I remember that. The eating facility was adequate to take care of all of the loggers and the men in the camp.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was the sleeping capacity of a bunkhouse in that camp?

**Mr. Canwell**: It seemed to me there might be from two to four men in each. They were quite crowded and that was a constant complaint. Some of the lumberjacks wouldn’t bathe and they became very fragrant and occasionally the others would take one out and throw him into the creek or run him out of the camp because he was too much of a problem.

The tents were probably 8-by-10. They might have even been 10-by-12, but they were not large.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did they have any of those camp units on or in boxcars?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, not to my knowledge at that time. They did have a caboose that sometimes went with the train. It was not unusual for some city dude to come up there fishing. I would imagine they were usually friends of the logging officials. But very early I learned to sell trout that I’d catch to these people who couldn’t catch them. The caboose, I think, accommodated them when they’d come up on these hunting or fishing forays.

**Mr. Frederick**: Within that hill and within that valley, what were the predominant ethnic groups out there?

**Mr. Canwell**: Ethnic? Some of the people living there at the time were temporary or transient and they were Spokane people. That was a different thing than the hill residents. The homesteaders and moonshiners of those people were from Tennessee. And they were storybook hillbillies, long stringy characters, most of whom could shoot straight, wouldn’t work other than make moonshine, and their wives did most of the gardening and other work.

Some of them were of a little higher type. I remember one, Charlie Crowfoot. He was an educated man, but the story was that he came out here just a couple of jumps ahead of the US Marshal. He may have had something to do with opening banks, but whatever it was, he was not illiterate. He was not like the other hillbillies and didn’t get along well with them. But, he, too, was a man who could take care of himself, so they didn’t give him any trouble.

One of my favorite stories that my father told was that one time he was out hunting in the woods as he often would. He would take his 30-30 along and hope to get a deer. There was a hillbilly family that raised a few sheep–the Spencers–and as my father was going along one of these game trails, he heard two rifle shots, one right after the other. So he proceeded on down the trail, but very cautiously and quietly.

He came into a little clearing and here was Charlie Crowfoot who had shot two of Spencer’s sheep. He had his rifle leaning across one of them while he was cutting the throat of the other. He looked up as my father walked into the clearing. It was a very tense moment because Crowfoot was prepared to shoot his way out of any confrontation with the owner of the sheep. My father didn’t know what he was walking into until he saw who it was.

So they stood there, my father standing and Crowfoot kneeling in the act of cutting this sheep’s throat. He’s looking at my father wondering what he’d do, my dad not knowing exactly what would develop. Finally Crowfoot said, “The son of a bitch bit me.”

Well, that was one of the highlight stories that I remember. Charlie Crowfoot was, like my father, a dead shot and a man of cold steel. I don’t know whatever became of him. Eventually one of his daughters married someone down near the Peone Store. That’s the last I knew of Charlie Crowfoot.

**Mr. Frederick**: If that was back of the Spencer’s property, that seems to be a pretty gutsy thing to do.

**Mr. Canwell**: It was pretty close to Spencer’s property, but Crowfoot had a continuing feud with Spencer, so he was very happy to take a couple of his sheep. Had Spencer been the one who came along the trail, it would have been a shootout between those people, so he was taking a substantial risk.

There were always things like that happening up there. I remember another incident with the Forker family. In one of our conversations, I mentioned that his son ran booze. George Forker, homesteader, used to feud with another man up there–Buck Peters. They were always just about at the shooting stage, but never got to that.

One day George Forker brought a package of meat, neatly wrapped in butcher paper, and left it on Buck Peters’ porch. Upon Peters finding it and seeing the tracks– and they could read tracks like we’d read a book–he thought, “Well, good old George, he wants to make up.” So he enjoyed the meat and when he saw Forker he thanked him for that roast he had left.

He said, “Oh, you didn’t eat that, did you? I delivered that for your dog.” He says, “My old mare died and I butchered her up for dog meat.” He knew in advance exactly what Peters would do with it. Well, the feud was on again and they never did get along after that. That’s the sort of thing that these hillbillies would do. They had a sense of humor and a contempt for everybody and everything. In general, they had working wives, wives who would keep the farm up, but they didn’t do much but hunt and make booze.

Another interesting story connected with that hill situation. A man, a lawyer, who had killed his partner in a feud in Kentucky, came out here to forget about it and to start a new life. He went way up on Mount Spokane and cut cordwood one year. He stayed up there, cutting cordwood, and then his instincts overcame him and he came into Spokane, opened a law office, put his shingle out. Well, this man eventually became a federal judge, J. Stanley Webster, and he was a very literate man. I used to go to federal court just to hear him give his instructions to the jury and that sort of thing, because of the beauty in his command of the language.

He was one of those who found his way up into this back country. Spokane at that time, as I said before, was a jumping-off place. It was the end of world. That’s where all the action was, out in this area. People were coming this way, the logging and mining was beginning to open up and they were all coming this way. And Judge J. Stanley Webster was one of them.

An interesting local sidecar to that, after he opened up his law office, and he was a Democrat, of course, from Kentucky, he began to move around in politics. Mr. Cowles, who ran the local newspaper, didn’t like that; Cowles was a Republican. So when he learned about Webster’s background, he began to refer to him in stories as “the killer” and make such references.

So one day Webster came into Cowles’ office at the newspaper building, introduced himself, put his six- shooter or “hog’s leg” down on the desk and said, “I’m J. Stanley Webster and you’ve been writing some bad things about me.” He said, “I did kill a man and he had it coming,” and, “If you write any more about it, I’ll kill you.”

Cowles and Webster became very good friends in later years. That was a story that I asked Webster about, if it were true. Well, he said it was something like that. But he was one of the characters who touched down in the backwoods up there.

**Mr. Frederick**: Were there any ethnic minorities within that valley?

**Mr. Canwell**: There were a few Germans. Ah, the Germans. One family that I remember was right west of Henricksen’s place. He was a German, had been a meat cutter or butcher in Germany. Nobody knows why people like that leave and come to a place like this. But, anyway, he and his wife were German and he was born in the Old Country, as I believe his wife was. His name was Seck.

Then down lower toward Peone Prairie there were several German families. I cannot think of their names. They were quite clannish. The Germans, all speaking the same language, would do so when other people were around and it was always resented.

There were quite a number of Scandinavians, too, like Henricksen, who was a Dane. My mother was Norwegian. I think there was a family or two of Scandinavians back up in the hills. They were among the more responsible people. I tend to remember the characters like the Spencers and others who were hillbillies and moonshiners, but there were a few very stable families that found their way out there for free land.

The Smedleys lived up in that area and developed a nice home, raised a family and did not get along with the hill folks because they weren’t the same kind. In general these hillbillies didn’t like people who were educated and refined. They were suspicious of them. They couldn’t get along with them. They were always criticized by the responsible people and so there never were good relations.

As to ethnic clusters, it would be the few Germans that I would think of and a few Scandinavians. Then here and there an Irisher, but nothing that created a problem ethnicwise. No blacks that I recall. I don’t even remember any within the work orbit. They didn’t hire them for logging and that sort of thing. There weren’t very many of them out here and most of the blacks worked in town in various occupations: in restaurants, as waiters in clubs, and so on.

**Mr. Frederick**: Were there any Chinese or Japanese out there?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, there were none of those there. There were some in Spokane, but not many. In the early days there was a small group of Chinese who came and established restaurants or laundries. There was a Chinese gardener or two. I remember that in town they’d have a wagon loaded with vegetables. They would drive through the neighborhoods and sell, but there were none up in the hills. No Chinese, no Negroes, there were Indians and that’s about it. The stock I would say was generally English, German, French and those mixes.

**Mr. Frederick**: Let’s begin to take the opportunity now to explore routine and schedule, particularly your mother. Would there be an identifiable routine associated with the days of the week with regard to what your mother would be doing?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, she usually would establish a baking day. It would probably be toward the first part of the week. She’d do that and she was doing laundry all the time, it seemed, because it needed to be done and she was a clean person. She wanted things immaculate and she’d scrub floors and things.

On Saturday, her day of worship, she didn’t move a muscle. That’s a day that she didn’t do any work. It was well understood that was her time, so other than the essentials that she just had to do, she took that day off. But the rest of the week it seemed to me that she was working, if not always early, always late. She was busy all day with a never-ending series of chores.

There was nobody much to visit with. In connection with that I remember there was one woman who lived off through the woods near the Parkers. Her husband was away most of the time and she was very lonely. She would find her way over to our place, which was two or three miles through the woods. And she would come over there to talk and visit. My mother was always happy to see her. She’d bring some small thing, some cookies, bread, jam, or something, and then my mother would fill her basket and send her home.

One of the interesting stories about her was that one day she was going home along this game trail and surprised a bear. The bear didn’t take to this, he attacked her and was mauling her quite thoroughly. She was screaming and yelling and no help was coming and the bear was scoring all the points.

Finally she just decided that if anything was to be done, she had to do it. So she booted this bear off and got up and kicked the stuffing out of it. And the bear ran off through the woods. Well, that’s the kind of woman she was. She was no sissy.

There were people like that there, but Mrs. Parker would be overcome with loneliness and make this long trek through to come up and chin with my mother. My mother would try to convert her to her religion., but I don’t think the woman responded particularly. All she wanted was company, somebody to talk to and relieve the loneliness.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was the wash routine?

**Mr. Canwell**: There was forever boiling of clothes being done. We sometimes had store-bought soap, but quite often she made our own soap. She made it with grease and lye in some combination that the pioneers used. They’d make a soap that was very strong. If you boiled clothes up with this lye-laden soap, it would pretty much boil the worst dirt away.

Then somewhere along there we acquired a primitive washing machine that operated with a crank. It turned a series of pegs back and forth to agitate the water. So you filled that up with soapy water and clothes and would crank that crank. I came in for some of that. That was quite a chore, but it was a step in the way of mechanizing clothes-washing.

**Mr. Frederick**: She would have that big copper washing kettle on the stove?

**Mr. Canwell**: It was a wash boiler. I would say it was probably 2 1/2’ long, 15” wide and 18” deep with handholds on each side. It had a cover that fit down into the top edge.

**Mr. Frederick**: She’d boil them and then what would she do with them?

**Mr. Canwell**: Then they’d be rinsed out and scrubbed, usually by hand on a washboard. That would be in a tub of water. We had a round tub; this tub would sit on a bench that was made for that. And she had a hand washboard. I don’t know whether you ever saw one, but they were a deadly instrument, but useful. She would take these clothes and scrub them up and down on this board, rinse them, and turn them over and scrub them some more. Then when that process was done they were rinsed in clean water a time or two and hung outside on a clothesline. She would save the water, which contained the soapsuds, to scrub the floor.

Another thing she had was bottles of bluing. She used to put this in the wash. It substituted for bleach. It did something to make them whiter, but I don’t know just what. It was the usual preparation used. That was hard work and she did a lot of it. There was no one else to do it. But she insisted on clean clothes.

**Mr. Frederick**: Some place along the line, would Pearl be old enough to help her or would Claude or James be old enough to help her on something like that?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, not very much. Usually they were either in school or during the vacation period they were out getting some sort of a paying job. They might be picking berries or anything like that. They didn’t participate much in that sort of thing. Maybe Jim did some of the dishes, but my sister, Pearl, and I seemed to end up on the dishwashing routine. That was a chore that has made me love the electric dishwasher.

We tried to do the things that could be done, like the carrying of water or rustling the wood. My father would haul wood up. It was cut with a crosscut saw in those days and usually, if you could, you got two people on a two-man saw, but more often than not it was a one-man operation. Then that wood was cut and stacked, enough of it kept dry so you could always start a fire. We gathered the pitch roots and that would be split into little pieces that could be used to ignite the fire and get it started well. That’s a product of the pine trees. Their roots would be very pitchy.

But all of us tried to do what we could to relieve my mother’s work. She was a compulsive worker. It couldn’t be blamed on anybody, she was just busy all the time.

**Mr. Frederick**: Okay, now with regard to some of Pearl’ s blouses and potentially some of your mother’ s blouses and whatnot, did she starch that and then have a  hot iron?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, she would starch and iron those. The irons were heated on the stove. You had a handle that you could fasten into them. You would lift the flatiron from the stove after installing the detachable handle. Then you would rub it over a cloth and some salt to be sure it was clean. Next it was waxed. They had bars or cakes of paraffin or beeswax. And they’d stroke the iron over the wax and then do the ironing.

She would starch the collars and the cuffs of my sister’s blouses. They would be ironed and done to perfection–just perfect–and she’d do her own finer things that way. Because she didn’t go much of any place except when she had moved into town, she didn’t do a whole lot for herself. But she did keep my sister, Pearl, in pretty good shape and she did her clothes, too.

The rest of us had long johns underwear and that sort of thing. I was thinking the other day when you were asking about my father’s apparel, I can remember that he did wear trousers that required suspenders. I can remember he had some wide suspenders. I think he brought them with him from the cavalry, but they were the type that would last forever.

**Mr. Frederick**: Up there, did your father have detachable starch collars that your mother would work on?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, he didn’t have anything like that nor would he have worn it if he did.

**Mr. Frederick**: So she didn’t have to iron any shirts for him then?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, she didn’t. The clothing that male members of the family wore were such that all they required was washing. They didn’t in general require ironing. Once in awhile there would be something that she’d want to smooth out.

To digress a little, another chore my mother engaged in was, when it was cold, she would get big boulders and heat them in the oven, then wrap them in newspaper and put them in the foot of our beds. That was delightful. You would crawl into a cold bed; there was blizzardy cold outside, and you put your feet on those warm rocks– it was just wonderful. She did everything in the world to make us comfortable, clean, and well-fed.

**Mr. Frederick**: Where would she hang the laundry in stormy weather?

**Mr. Canwell**: In the stormy weather it was usually dried indoors. I can remember some improvised racks or things, where clothes would be hanging and sometimes drying near the heating stove and sometimes near the cookstove. I think that she probably avoided doing blankets and sheets and things when the weather was not favorable. She always did an incredible amount of work and she was that way all her life. She remained that way when she was in town or in the country.

**Mr. Frederick**: You mentioned that your father would be the first one up. He would start breakfast, generally a cereal of some kind for the kids?

**Mr. Canwell**: That was quite a usual procedure. If mother had any luxury by way of rest, it would be in bed in the morning. My father went to bed early, he got up early, and he’d build a fire. Usually we ate a lot of oatmeal. He’d put on a pot of oatmeal. I always remember it because the darned stuff so stuck to the kettles that you had a heck of a time washing them. They must put something in it nowadays so they don’t do that. Sometimes my mother would make some hotcakes later in the day or on weekends.

**Mr. Frederick**: About what time would you have dinner?

**Mr. Canwell**: Usually at six o’clock and in those days it was called supper. If there was ever a dinner, it was a special occasion or something. But you had breakfast and supper, sometimes there was a lunch, but usually it was breakfast and supper. That was at six o’clock and you’d better be there. That went that way all of my life at home.

Over the years my father did the same things. He’d get up early and put on cereal or something and a pot of coffee if he happened to want it. He didn’t drink much coffee. He would try to roust us out of bed before mother got up.

Up in the hills, the children who went to school had to leave about seven o’clock in the morning. It was pretty early, sometimes it was still dark and it would be dark when they got home.

Other than school events, there was no place to go for social life or entertainment. They had a dance hall that had been built by the logging operators. It was down in the woods toward the store, but that wasn’t a place that our family frequented.

Then if someone, like this lady who would find her way over there to visit, would come over, that was about the extent of visiting. George Henricksen, the Dane, was not a particularly interesting person to visit with. He was there, and that’s about all. Over the hill there was the German family, the Secks.

**Mr. Frederick**: How would the routine vary during canning season?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, during the canning season there was less laundry done and more boiling up of fruit or vegetables. It seemed to me that my mother would fill jars with some of the things she was canning, then put them in hot water, and they were cooked in the jars. I don’t remember all the particulars, but that was a technique that she used on some things. I think to prevent botulism and spoilage on any beans or peas or things like that, she would cook them in the jars.

In our root cellar we had shelves that were filled with canned food. There also were bins of potatoes, rutabagas, carrots, onions, and usually a bin of apples that kept well, like Wagners. So for a good share of the year we’d have fresh fruit and when we didn’t, we had canned fruit.

**Mr. Frederick**: Albert, how long were the camps out there? How much opportunity did he have to work part time with the blacksmith?

**Mr. Canwell**: A good share of the time that we were up there. He did other things, as well; the lumber company wanted a large barn built, a big storage and hay barn, and he built that. I don’t remember what year it was. I believe my uncle, Aaron, also worked building that barn. My father had skills like that; he could do that sort of thing.

Anyway, that barn stood there for many years on a farm down below the hill, below our place. In fact, one or two years we lived on that farm, down on the flatland after the time he built the barn there. Then for a time we rented a house that was built on that property. That was a little closer to school. As to the date that occurred, I just remember that we were talking about newspapers and stories about the war shaping up. It seemed to me it was about 1914. There would be headlines in the papers and that’s about what I remember there.

As to stock on the farm, we had a band of sheep. We used the little sheepdog in managing and handling them. We had a stallion that serviced mares that were brought there. That brought in some money. Anyway, there was income during part of that time, one way or another, from the logging camp or building the barn or breeding mares.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did he ever own a team and a wagon?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, the first one that we had was a team of draft horses, a beautiful and very valuable team, my grandfather sent up, thinking that was just what my father needed. But it wasn’t that kind of a farm really. They were...it was like giving somebody a Cadillac where what you needed was a Model T Ford. He did use those horses and hired them out in some of the logging. Then, a tragedy occurred. These horses broke loose one time, got into the granary, foundered on the grain, and died. That was very sad and unfortunate.

**Mr. Frederick**: And your father would eventually have to tell his father-in-law what happened to that team?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, he did and that was–

**Mr. Frederick**: It must have been a terribly–

**Mr. Canwell**: It was a sad thing.

**Mr. Frederick**: –embarrassing thing to have to tell him.

**Mr. Canwell**: His father-in-law was very fond of my father and I think he understood that it was a tragedy and couldn’t be helped. My grandfather had never been up there. He didn’t know what kind of a farm it was really. And a team of that size was not required. What we used and we acquired from time to time would be what they called “cayuses.” They were smaller range horses and some of them were good, some bad. But they could be used for plowing and cultivating or hauling a log up to the woodpile or they could be ridden for saddle horses. So that’s what you usually strived for up there, you wanted a workhorse that was a saddle horse and not so big that he ate too much. The big draft horses were too expensive to maintain; other than a few of them in the logging operation you didn’t see that sort of horse in the hills.

**Mr. Frederick**: Your father didn’t have much choice. He would have to gather logs with that team, he wouldn’t know what else to do with them.

**Mr. Canwell**: That’s all that could be done and I don’t remember how much of that he did but he did some. They would cut logs, which would be skidded down to the lower area. They had a sort of sled-like device similar to a travois that you could get the log on and then drag it. The tail end of the log would be on the dirt, but the front end would be on this sled-like device. Horses like that could have no trouble hauling one of these big logs that were tremendously heavy. That’s how the logs were brought down to the landing area in those days. Later they began to use cables and pulleys, but they did not use those to my knowledge at that time.

**Mr. Frederick**: That probably would have been late coming in, too. Because of lack of underbrush and what- not, they could log with those horses for a long time over here.

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, they did the job very well. The area sloped toward the basin and the stream. Their problem was to keep from going too fast, to avoid overrunning the team and driver. It seemed to me they had some sort of a drag brake or snubbing device on the trays of the dragging sled that they could activate.

**Mr. Frederick**: Some of those teams were so trained and so experienced that they could be controlled almost by voice command. Those horses really did know what they were doing.

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes. Horses are pretty stupid animals, but they can learn to follow orders and do what they’re trained to do. If you keep them in that routine, they’re very, very efficient. And that sort of thing he understood. He knew horses from the work standpoint and the saddle or riding standpoint. My mother knew them from the other angle. She babied and broke them by affection and the kind treatment and a carrot approach, but that was not my father’s way. He did handle horses and got the job done.

**Mr. Frederick**: Today I would take the opportunity to begin to explore the seasons within this region as you remember them up there on the homestead. Let’s begin with summertime and the month that we could say, “Yes, summer is here.”

**Mr. Canwell**: The seasons there were very marked as they are as you get into higher mountain areas. The winters were quite cold with lots of snow. We always looked forward to the breaking of spring, which would begin in March. It would warm up a little, the snow would begin to melt, and the streams enlarged. But spring really didn’t come until along in April and May.

In that period of time the gardening started. The potatoes were planted earlier than other things. They took advantage of the seasons to first plant things that were frost-resistant and then, later on, the things that had to be protected from the colder weather. My recollection is that it probably was well into April before we did any serious gardening and the soil began to dry out enough so there was no mud up there.

Then we’d go into the spring season when strawberries would begin to come on and some of the garden things would be developing. I remember my mother was quite a believer in salads and green things. She would go out and gather a potherb that she called lamb’s-quarters. She seemed to be able to find it and I never have since then known just how to identify it, but it was a type of green similar to spinach, a delightful thing. If you can make any spinach delightful, that was.

Then, of course, we’d have the garden things like radishes and other things that came along. Green onions and those things were planted in enough abundance so we had plenty of them. Onions then were not used in the early stages as green onions. They were left to develop and became the dry onions that were stored in the root cellar.

The potatoes, as I mentioned, were planted fairly early. I can remember my mother robbing the potato plants. She would go out when they got to a certain stage and would reach in the dirt and come up with little potatoes. We’d have new potatoes and fresh green peas with a white sauce over them. But they were potatoes that were robbed from the growing plant.

We had tomatoes that came on very late in the season. The other things like lettuce and all of those things came along in their turn and were utilized. We had an asparagus bed, too. It came from starts that Grandfather Espelund had sent up from Walla Walla or College Place that he had obtained at the Milton Nursery. Those plants thrived and went on, it seemed to me forever. Until recently there were still asparagus plants up there. The garden area was a very important thing. My mother was very active in that area. All of her life she felt it was sort of immoral not to have a garden. So every place we lived we usually had a garden plot. Up there the garden was abundant. As the years went on, it was difficult to replace that eroding soil that washed off of the hilltop and down to the gravel base. But we did have a wonderful garden.

I described the fruit trees earlier and my mother’s method of drying their fruits.

**Mr. Frederick**: Albert, was that garden fertilized from the manure out of the barn and was it hand-watered?

**Mr. Canwell**: It was fertilized from the barn manures and when we first went up there we got some of that fertilizer from our neighbor, George Henricksen. But as we had our own horses and cows, we were able to produce more of it. Every bit of it was utilized. It was very essential, and there were no commercial fertilizers.

That was another area in which my mother was very well-informed. She grew up on a farm down near Walla Walla, where they gardened and did it skillfully and productively. She utilized that knowledge to help in the development of our garden. I think she knew a lot more about it than my father did.

However, he did the hard work of tilling. He cultivated the thing with a hand cultivator you pushed–no motors, of course. And a hoe and a rake and those things were utilized to keep the weeds down.

You asked about the watering. Some water was carried to the newly planted trees. We seemed to be forever carrying water up there and pouring a bucket or two on each developing tree. But they soon adapted and could have used the water, but it wasn’t available nor did they require it. The trees seemed to grow and thrive without it. There was sufficient rain usually to help in that area. The snow did not leave as early up there in the highlands as it did down in the lower areas. So I suppose that the general moisture required for these trees was a little less up there than it would have been down on Peone Prairie.

This orchard was sort of a phenomenon up there in the hills. The hill people might have one apple tree or one cherry tree or something like that, but they never developed larger orchards. I suppose they didn’t have the availability of trees like we did that my grandfather sent up from Walla Walla.

**Mr. Frederick**: And she used also the chicken manure?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh yes, and again, that was used more on the plants, raspberry plants and things. It’s a very hot manure and you have to use it advisedly. I can remember she mixed that with dirt and mulch and used that to prevent burning the plants. She understood those things. The manure was, as is customary, gathered and stacked in a pile back of the chicken house and the barn. We always tried to have some of it decay there because it became more desirable for certain uses. That, I think, would apply to things like flowers, which I might mention, too.

We did have some flowers up there. I remember hollyhocks. I don’t know that I’ve seen much of them in recent years, but that was one of the things we seemed to have quite a number of.

She grew something they called strawflowers. Those were dried and made into little ornamental bouquets. They remained intact so that all year you had this little show of color for ornamentation.

My mother always had flowers, but I do not remember too well what all of them were, except she came up with color all the time, and attractiveness.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did it get hot up there in the summertime?

**Mr. Canwell**: It got pretty hot, yes. My recollection is that when you went barefoot, as we often did, you were very aware of the hot gravel and things in the path. I remember another annoying thing that came with the hot weather. There was an abundance of flies. The store would sell fly ribbon about the size of a camera film that you pulled off a spool. The ribbon was coated with a sticky substance. You hung the spool up with the ribbon dangling and the flies would get stuck to the ribbon. That was one way you controlled them. We didn’t have these sprays and things that we have now. Of course, we did have screens over the windows and screen doors and things like that to prevent their access to the house.

Another thing I remember there were these yellowjackets and hornets. I associate that with going bare- foot, because you had to be careful you didn’t step on one or into their nest.

The garden itself had pest problems. Besides insects, there were ground squirrels. And as you know they dig holes and mound up the dirt and are a general nuisance. Later on I remember my father providing me ammunition for the .22 and encouraging me to pick off these ground squirrels. And I got pretty good at it.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was the average temperature in the summertime up there?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, golly, I would not know. I don’t think we got much 80 and 90 temperature. We’re up high enough so it was a little cooler, there was always a breeze. But I was aware that you could–very early in the spring– begin to run around without a shirt on and get a tan.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was the elevation?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, I think it was around 2,500 feet. Now that’s a guess; but 2,000 or 2,500 because it was about half what it would have been on Mount Spokane, which is almost a mile high.

**Mr. Frederick**: And when did it start to turn fall up there?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, usually in October. There was what we called an Indian summer. I guess they had that all over in this area. The leaves would begin to change color and mornings would be pretty snappy. In October would be the real feeling of fall and the threat of winter. But we’d be well into Thanksgiving or later before there was serious snow.

**Mr. Frederick**: Within the house during winter nights, did your father bank that heating stove, and maybe the cookstove that would have coals in there, all night?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, as I recall it would be the dampers that would be throttled down. There would be wood in there smoldering. You could open the stove in the morning, open the drafts, and the smoldering wood would burst into flame. That was a regular procedure. It also kept the rooms a little warmer than outside. We always had wood stacked by both stoves, particularly in the very cold weather. In fact, sometimes in the colder weather when it reached 20o or 10o, the stoves might just be kept going full-blast.

**Mr. Frederick**: Within those tents in the wintertime, did you keep those little stoves going?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, they’re a very efficient facility. They’re still available. I see them once in awhile. They are little sheet metal stoves controlled by a chimney damper and front damper. You could bank those up with quite a bit of wood and control it to just the amount of burning that you wish. It would, of course, be easy to get too much warmth in those small tent areas, so we learned to do that in an efficient way.

Some things are sharp in my memory. Your shoes would get wet sometimes. We oiled them or greased them to prevent that, but in spite of that your stockings at times would be wet. In this coldest weather if you hung your stockings near the stove, if there wasn’t heat, they’d freeze. They wouldn’t dry, but usually that was not a problem.

But I don’t remember winters as unpleasant; maybe time has erased some things. I still think of the hills up there as home. I never quite got over that. I have very few unpleasant memories of that time. We were comfort-able. We were a happy family. We were a little more civilized than some of the hill families. And so I think that part was all right.

We had things that we missed and some shortages. We were a long ways from the dentist or a doctor and a long ways from stores. We didn’t have a lot of money. But, anyway, the recollections are pleasant. They’re enhanced by comparing the hustle, bustle, and strife of our time with the tranquillity of that time. There’s a great contrast. There was no TV, no radio; you went to bed early and normally got up early. The beds were warm and adequate and in general it was a pleasant existence, along with the hardships that we didn’t call hardships.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was the schedule for bathing?

**Mr. Canwell**: The bathing was usually in a large wash tub filled with warmed water. I think it was almost universal at that time–you didn’t have bathtubs and running water. I can remember a tub and chair by it so you could put your feet in there; they needed more washing usually than the rest of the body. My mother washed us when we were smaller children. You seemed to have quite a lot of that going on, more than I liked at the time. But that was it. You heated water on the stove and took the chill off the bath water you were using,

**Mr. Frederick**: When was bath day?

**Mr. Canwell**: I think it was usually handled on a weekend when you had more time to heat bath water without interfering with other activities. My mother was always very meticulous about that. She might make the kids do a partial bath or something, wash their feet and so on. She wouldn’t let them go to school in any way that she felt was improper. That was a way of life up there with our family. You kept clean and it wasn’t easy.

**Mr. Frederick**: So we’re talking maybe Saturday?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, probably more likely Sunday, because my mother observed Saturday to the best of her ability and didn’t engage in things that could be done at any other time. I don’t know what you know about the Adventists. They are like the Jews. When the sun goes down Friday, that’s their day of worship until it goes down the next day. She pretty well observed that. She tried to schedule her week and her chores and activities so that she had this one day of rest and religious contemplation. She didn’t have a church to go to. There wasn’t any such thing up there. So as I recall that is the reason bathing had to be on Sunday.

**Mr. Frederick**: And she would run everyone through that process if they needed it or not?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, that was a standard operating procedure. Of course, the older boys particularly tried to avoid as much of it as possible, but they were never successful. They were clean...period.

**Mr. Frederick**: Would your father bathe also on Sunday?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, and he would be more likely to bathe during the week. Particularly if he was going to the store or something, that would be part of the procedure; a bath and washing, and more likely during the week than during the Weekend Scrub-Out.

**Mr. Frederick**: Could you get all of those children with one tub or would you have to change it some place along the line?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, it would be changed because we kids were pretty finicky, too. As I recall it wasn’t a great amount of water, it was just enough to make it adequate.

I can remember my mother washing all of us with a large washcloth and soap. Sometimes in working over your face you might get a bite of that strong soap or a taste of it. But she did a pretty enthusiastic job of washing our hair and ears. I thought sometimes she’d remove them in the process. But we went through the procedure and there was no way of avoiding it.

**Mr. Frederick**: With regard to the outhouse, how did your mother or your father treat that outhouse?

**Mr. Canwell**: It was treated with lime, I believe. And then many outhouses were built so that there was access at the back for cleaning them out. I do remember that lime particularly was used as a sort of disinfectant and deodorant and pest controller. That again was standard operating procedure for people who were concerned about the unpleasant effects or parts of that process.

I remember they got that in sacks something like a gunnysack and that was another thing that was hauled up from either the store, Mead or Hillyard. It was obtained and regularly available. I don’t remember all of the particulars about it, but I just know it was there. There may have been other things used to treat the outhouses, but I don’t know what they would be.

**Mr. Frederick**: Well, let’s begin the process today of exploring and walking with you through the school process. You’ve mentioned that the first school that you attended was Beaver Creek School?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, it was. Beaver Creek School is up at the north end, northeast end of Peone Prairie, about four miles from our mountain residence. My older brothers and sisters started to school several years before I did because of the great distance and the problems of getting there. As a small child I was kept at home until I was almost eight. My schooling was not really neglected because during that time all of their homework and books and things were brought out and my mother had some books that I used to learn to read and write.

Some of the hillbillies decided somewhere along the line that their children needed some education, so they would enroll them in this school. You might in the first grade be sitting next to somebody 15 or 17 years old who was in the first grade. Anyway, because of the hazards, the distance, and the difficulties, I did not enroll when I would have been eligible, but I did learn to read and write and maybe developed a habit of self-education that was both good and bad in my life. When I did enroll in the country school, I spent one year there and then at that time we moved into town.

**Mr. Frederick**: How did you feel about that at the time? Your brothers and sisters were going to school, you knew that other children within the area were going to school, and then you were not allowed to go to school. Were you for that or against that?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, I felt a little deprived. I’d see them going off to school and it sounded like fun and, of course, I wanted to do that, too. But I adjusted to that thing. They left for school very early in the morning and we waited for them to appear in the evening. Sometimes it was dark before they’d get home and, as I mentioned earlier, my mother was very worried until she would see them finally trek up the hill to our place. You could hear coyotes or wolves howling off in the distance and it was an unsettling thing. But answering your question, I did want to go, but it just wasn’t possible.

**Mr. Frederick**: What did your mother tell you? What did she say to you about that?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, she explained that it just wasn’t possible for me to walk and keep up with them over that great distance and therefore she would take care of my schooling at home until I was big enough to go. She worked pretty hard at that. She helped me learn to read and write and recognize the letters and formulate them myself. I probably did much better than if I had been taught where one teacher had all of these kids of varying sizes and mentality and a real tough problem.

That in itself is a story, about how they get teachers there and lose them. Because it was way out in the sticks, the teachers would be somebody who couldn’t find work or hold a contract elsewhere, so they’d settle up there. But in spite of that we had some very fine teachers.

These teachers had a hard job of discipline because, when they had a man teacher, eventually he probably would get in a knockdown fist fight with one of the students who was bigger than he was. That student might be in the first or second grade. Usually the male instructor would decide that was not for him and he’d leave.

And then they’d get a woman teacher. Then the process was a little different. The teacher lived with the inhabitants near the school. They took turns living at one house for a month and then at another house and usually it was a rugged situation because these hillbilly women were always jealous and worried about an educated female living in the house. So that might have an almost tragic ending. It was not usual for the teacher to finish a year in teaching there.

I remember one teacher, a young woman who came from quite a well-known family in Spokane, a business family. As soon as she settled in at one of these residences, the wife, of course, went through her belongings and snooped to see what was there. The things she found led her to say that no decent woman would need that sort of paraphernalia and she made a great big issue of it. This poor gal finally left in midterm up there. But that was always an unstable situation, the teaching was. They did have some good instructors.

**Mr. Frederick**: Considering what you speak of and considering that there were families up there that were concerned with regard to education, was there ever a movement before World War I to pool resources and build a teacherage cottage, potentially right up against the schoolhouse?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, that never occurred down at the Beaver Creek School. Years later a school was built at the site of the old abandoned logging camp, along with a cabin to accommodate a teacher. But this was not done at the Beaver Creek School. The housing problem for the teachers was solved by rotating them around with neighbors who were near enough to the school to make it possible to walk to school.

**Mr. Frederick**: When was the new schoolhouse built?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, that was built after we left the hills. The precise date I don’t know, I just know that it eventually appeared and they used it for a meeting hall, as well. I think they called it the Mount Carlton Town Hall. Then that was made into a school and they developed a little cabin or dwelling for a schoolteacher. But that happened after we moved out of there. I was aware of it because I would go up there periodically over the years and spend time at the place.

**Mr. Frederick**: You have mentioned that you were approximately eight years old when you had the opportunity to walk with your two older brothers and sister to school, which would place that about in 1915. Do you remember lobbying your mother to attend that year?

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, I think that I always bugged her about going to school, because that was activity. They had lunches packed up and they were doing something unusual and I was not a party to it. So I think I complained about it and was anxious to start school there.

I so well remember my first day in that country school. I recall this teacher, a woman teacher, a very able person, going to the blackboard. There was a big blackboard all across the end of the room and she had a large stick, a pointer, which she used for various things, sometimes to rap a kid over the head. But, anyway, my first recollection is that everybody was required to be seated. She walked up to the blackboard with her pointer and had the alphabet across the top of the board. She stated her name and said, “I am your teacher. You are here to learn.” And then went from there. She was a very stern disciplinarian and it was a contest all the way with these varying-sized and temperamentally maladjusted children or at least with some of them. She had quite a job. But she handled it very well.

I can think of the first thing that I did when I was permitted. I zeroed in on the little library they had. I still remember the book that fascinated me and I grabbed it. It was the Bears of Blue River. I’ve never seen it since, but it was the first book that I’d had access to outside of the few we had at home. That fascinated me and whatever was readable there I read. If you wheedled enough you could take a book home over the weekend, but it was not the usual thing. I just have some vivid memories of that first year at school. We used to play ball, a sort of hide-and-seek thing, where you’d throw the ball over the school and the one who caught it would run around and try to hit somebody with it. We also played a crude baseball there. I once was up to bat and was hit smack on the nose with a baseball and it flattened my nose and it bled profusely. It was a horrible situation and nothing much could be done about it. This is an occasion I described previously, when my father’s medical training came into use; that night, my father took a pencil-like probe, and probed up my nose and readjusted the bone structure with his fingers. He got me to breathing and my nose straightened up.

**Mr. Frederick**: And what was the schoolteacher’s name?

**Mr. Canwell**: Miss Jennaway. I’m trying to think of some of the highlights of that first year at school. Some of the children I’ve remembered all my life.

**Mr. Frederick**: Albert, let’s describe that schoolhouse, beginning with the exterior and then describing the interior?

**Mr. Canwell**: It was a one-room building. I suppose the floor area might have been 30 or 40 feet by maybe 50 or a little more. It was not large. It had a heating stove in the corner just a little beyond the entrance. When we first started there it had no porch. They built one on later, a covered porch and entrance, but when I first went there it had only a doorway and a rock or a log step that you stepped on to accomplish the difference in elevation.

Inside there was this large stove with a metal screen partially around it. And there were pegs on the wall to hang clothes. There was a reason for the clothes pegs being close to the stove because a lot of the children would come there through rain or snow and their garments would be wet. They dried the clothes by the stove that was used to warm the entire school.

**Mr. Canwell**: I remember so well so many things about my interest in the school there, because I had entered school late. So I had not been deprived by this process. I was so anxious to attend and so overwhelmed with the fact that there were a lot of children there, and a teacher authority, and everything else, that it has remained in my memory and mind. Some of the children who went there and their names I don’t recall, except that they were part of that scene.

The seating was made up of double seats with a desk. It was all one unit and you shared this desk with somebody else. There were at least two rows of these double desks the whole length of the room. At the north end there was an elevated area, I suppose a foot higher than the general floor and the teacher’s desk was up there.

A large blackboard covered almost the whole end of the room. That blackboard was used to outline the day’s work and various things to give the emphasis that the teacher wanted to various things. You’d go up there to do your arithmetic to prove that you could add and subtract. It was done on this blackboard with the whole school observing you. This has a tendency, I think, to make you want to do it right; it was not a bad thing. The school was one room with eight grades.

I remember particularly the children who were constant disturbances or troublemakers or funny, but it was an unusual experience that’s remained with me all my life.

**Mr. Frederick**: What was the reader that you used out there?

**Mr. Canwell**: At the school? I would have to be guessing but think it was probably a McGuffey; somewhere along the line, they were McGuffey Readers. I know they became common, that they were generally used and I would say that’s what it was, but I couldn’t be positive.

**Mr. Frederick**: Who were some of the fellow students that you remember?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, I remember the Fuher family who had the sawmill right near there. They were considered among the elite. There was a little daughter and she was a doll. Her name was Irma. I’ll never forget her. I would have taken her home to keep.

There was the Neff family and they were important to us because they lived about halfway between our home and the school. We used to cut down through the woods and follow the old railroad track to get to school. Where we were intersected by the main Greenbluff road, the Neffs lived back in the brush. They had a mailbox and a gate there. If we arrived first we’d put a stick up there on the gate and if they had been there first and went on to school they’d leave a sign. So usually we tried to rendezvous with the Neff family. There were two or three of them; we had a very pleasant association as children.

There was another family right near there, the Deckers. I remember them, and the Bachelors. The Bachelors had several girls and were nice, pleasant people. Over the years I’ve kept track of some of them, or the family has. They had a no-good father who eventually was arrested for child molesting or something, but the children were good children and they were part of the children there.

There were others I remember quite well, but not necessarily by name. There was a young man, and he was definitely a man. I believe he was one of the Forkers. He walked about twice as far as we did to get to school. He was back up in the far hills toward Mount Spokane. He or his family had decided he should get some education.

One of his older brothers had been to school and been out and around the world, but this boy had not had the benefits of that.

He came to school and I can remember he carried a lunch in a lard bucket. They had five-and ten-pound lard buckets in those days which were commonly used for lunch buckets. He would have his bucket stuffed full of fried potatoes, pancakes, and that sort of thing. It was enough to feed an army. He’d sit down and eat the whole works. Anyway, he was one of the man-sized students in the lower grades there. He was no problem, no trouble; he was obedient, not too bright an individual.

Then there was the Jack family. They lived down toward Spokane on Peone Prairie, but near the school. They had four or five kids. One of the children later worked with me in the Spokane sheriffs office.

I remember at a Christmas affair, which was one of social events that would occur, they’d have a Christmas party and show, in which the kids would participate and the families would come in to observe and be a part of it. The Jack family sat down in the front row; they were in stair steps and one of these hillbillies was quite an artist, Benny McLaughlan. Sitting back of them, he took a piece of paper and scissors that he seemed to carry with him and he cut a silhouette of this stair step group of children. It was a priceless thing. I wish I had it because anybody seeing that would recognize the Jack family.

They were quite civilized people, too. They were not strictly hillbillies. We called them flatlanders. They lived down on the prairie and had farms that were more prosperous. It was fertile soil and they raised lots of hay and other farm crops.

There was a German family, the Mildus family. They had, I think, three children. Their father was a tyrant. If the weather permitted, they were kept home from school to work and about the only times they ever showed up in school were when it was snowing or raining or the weather was such that they couldn’t do any work at home.

**Mr. Frederick**: How many students were in that room that first year?

**Mr. Canwell**: I would say there must have been around 30. I would guess that would be about what the room would accommodate and the seats were all filled. There was pretty faithful attendance there. Of course, the kids wanted to get away from home and get to school. There was a lot of activity, there were children to play with and things to do.

**Mr. Frederick**: I was going to say that must have been very exciting for you to be around that many children.

**Mr. Canwell**: Oh, it was, because other than my brothers and my sister I saw almost no children up there. The hill folks who had children lived back up in the hills and we had no real contact with them. We just knew they were around or would see them going back and forth to the store once in awhile. But we had no one to play with except our family.

**Mr. Frederick**: What did you pack for lunches?

**Mr. Canwell**: Well, my mother was forever making bread. We always had good bread and quite often rolls or cookies. The sandwiches were more often than not made from peanut butter or peanut butter and jelly. We bought peanut butter in these five-pound pails, which eventually became lunch buckets. Usually those were used by most everybody for lunch buckets. If we had fruit, there would usually be an apple in the bucket. Another thing we always had were dried apples which we often munched on the way to school. But the lunches were quite adequate.

Mother was a genius at frying chicken. I suppose the health nuts now would think that was not good for you, but that was one of the desirable things that I remember all my life, my mother’s frying these pans of chicken. It seemed like she’d take all day doing it. They’d be patiently browned and tasty. The leftover chicken became part of the lunch.

The hill people were pretty strong on pork and bacon. They all had pigs, so for butter in their lunch, they might use lard. Such things would be abhorrent to my mother and so we didn’t do that sort of thing. These hill people had meats and wild game.

**Mr. Frederick**: With regard to Claude, James, and Pearl, walking with them to school, walking with them back home after school, and being with them during the daytime that year at school, how would you rate them as chaperons or supervisors or helpmates of you?

**Mr. Canwell**: They were always very protective, and particularly protective of my sister. It would have been very perilous for anybody to give my sister any trouble. In addition to that, this little dog that I mentioned always accompanied the children to school. You needed no more protection than this dog. But the boys were protective. I think they were excessively fond of my sister.

I don’t remember where I fit in the pecking order, but I was there and had no problems. The older boys were quite athletic and self-sufficient and could well take care of themselves in the altercations that would all automatically develop in the schoolyard. I don’t recall that at any time as being a problem.

**Mr. Frederick**: Claude and James would run together and then maybe it would be you and Pearl?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, we pretty much stayed in a group, particularly on the way to school. The older boys would sometimes have to slow down a little to keep us in sight or in orbit, but it was not a matter of them stringing out and leaving us. We stayed in a group pretty well. There was the constant feeling that there were some natural hazards such as coyotes, cougars, and so on; they were always around.

**Mr. Frederick**: You have mentioned that you had the opportunity to spend that year there and then your family moved into town. What were the circumstances for that move?

**Mr. Canwell**: The circumstances largely had to do with my mother’s health. She developed some problems and it just seemed advisable to move into town. The living up there was too rugged and there were no medical facilities. I remember she had some infection in her ear that required attention. It was a combination of those things that prompted us to move into town.

**Mr. Frederick**: Was that looked forward to with anticipation, with excitement?

**Mr. Canwell**: Yes, I think that we, the children, all looked forward to it as a move in the right direction. Now, keep in mind, or you might have in mind, that over the past years we had occasionally moved into town and spent the winter. I don’t remember just how much of that there was, but there was some. The older boys were more aware of the excitement of living in the city than Pearl and I were because we were so small when we went up there. But I think that we looked forward to it with some pleasure and anticipation.

**Mr. Frederick**: Did you take the household furnishings with you?

**Mr. Canwell**: No, we took only some of the furnishings. On this trip, the final trip to town, we did take some furnishings. It seemed to me that it was all loaded on a wagon, sort of a hayrack and we had furniture and kidssticking out all over. We went into town and to a house that had been pre-rented for the purpose. Of course, I remember that well and the address of the house.

**Mr. Frederick**: Albert, let’s spend some time thinking about the effects of World War I on the community as you perceived it?

**Mr. Canwell**: In thinking of World War I, one of my strongest recollections is that there were great shortages of food and staples and that started even before we left the hills in 1916. You couldn’t buy white flour. You couldn’t get sugar. My mother would make biscuits or bread using shorts and bran and maybe just a little flour in it. We didn’t have sugar and we depended on honey, which was often gathered from the wilds up there. We quite often had a sufficient amount of honey for sweetening.

There was no coffee or tea available for awhile. I can remember my mother browning grains in the oven to make a substance to create a sort of coffee–something like Postum. It wasn’t the best in the world, but it was something. That was a result of the shortages. I’m not sure that some of these weren’t created as a conditioning, a mental conditioning, for people to adjust to the coming war and its demands. I think that was a factor, but there were shortages and we were very aware of them. As we moved on into town and a major war developed, there were increased shortages.

At school we learned to knit little squares that were made into blankets and sent off to the military camps, or allegedly that’s where they were going. I suppose I could still do that knitting if I tried to. We’d make these little squares. And the people were supposed to supply the yarn and the needles. That was a project at school; you’d make these things to be a part of the war effort.

Then you were aware that people were being drafted and going to war. By the end of the war, we had moved to the house on Third Avenue. And I can remember that there was a false armistice that occurred. It must have been right around the 1st of November. Everybody flocked downtown to celebrate the thing and then the word came through that it was no armistice, no dice. So in about ten days, the 11th of November, the real thing happened and we went through this process again.

I can remember walking downtown from Third Avenue, which was nearly three miles out of downtown, to watch the celebration. The town went wild. People were yelling and hollering and singing and dancing in the streets and everything else. I well remember that, and I don’t know where they got their booze. I think it was during Prohibition, but there was quite a lot of booze flowing. It was probably Mount Spokane moonshine. Anyway there was a lot of noisy celebration and I remember that well.
