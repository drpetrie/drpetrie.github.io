Historical Context and Life Summary:

Philip was born in England in 1879. He came to the US with his family in July 1889. His father was a miner who appears to have immigrated to Illinois to work in the coal mines.

Philip died in a fire in the mine. He was the boss of all the mines in the Taylorville area. He was not supposed to go into the mine but he did and his mask did not work and he died in the mine. Peabody Coal was located in St. Louis and the president of the company came down for the funeral. The president told grandma White to pick out a house for her and the children. She picked a big house for a big family. The house  was on Main Street across the from where later Grandma Helen and my Mom and Dad lived. A lot smaller house. He also told Grandma that the company would pay for college if the kids wanted to go. I only know of Mom going to college at Lake of the Woods College in MO. Not very far from from the U of MO. I have seen an article in the local paper that she was on the swim team.  - Robert Mcward 12/26/2021

Report of a Death in Oxygen Breathing Apparatus

West Frankfort, Franklin County

At about 6:30 p. m. July 24, 1920, a fire was discovered in an old pair of panels in By Products Coke Corporation Mine No. 18, West Frankfort. It was almost wholly extinguished but not quite, because all the fire extinguishers on hand had been used. Upon return, the fire had rekindled, and sealing was then done. On July 28th one seal of the pair was broken for an oxygen breathing apparatus crew to enter for inspection. Benton, Herrin, and DuQuoin teams, county and State inspectors, and local and district management of the corporation were present. 

On first inspection, smoke was found and a helmet wearer, the county inspector, was overcome. In thirty minutes he was out by the seal and revived. On the second inspection, the district superintendent was likewise overcome. It took much longer to bring him out and he could not be revived. Three doctors were on hand upon bringing him back out by the seal. He was ill and had vomited. This clogged the mica valves, thus stopping the flow of oxygen.
