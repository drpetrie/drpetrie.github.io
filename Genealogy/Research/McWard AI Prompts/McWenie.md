That night Bridge Street roared with gunfire and boiled with bullets as Herrera's outlaw friends came, trying to. hoot Billy Green and his brothers, Zac and El Green out of Green's restaurant located in the second building west of tbe bridge, on the north side of Bridge St. 'The Greens held the raiders off, but whining lead made the townspeople nervous, so the mayor wired Washington for permission to disperse the outlaws with the troops.

When the troops were called out, McWenie followed them to the corner of what is now Twelfth Street and National. There they stopped, were given the order of "fix bayonets" and at a trot charged up Bridge Street with fixed bayonets. The outlaws simply "melted away" disappearing into the shadows and the Green brothers lived on until Billy Green was eventually killed by an outlaw near Trinidad, Colo. MeWenie recalled.

Widely known as banker, Pet milk salesman and City Clerk under the administration of three mayors, McWenie was a member of the first full term class graduated from the old New Mexica Normal University, now Highlands University. Graduating in 190l. he was active in school athletics. serving on the University football team as quarterback in 1900-1901 and on the baseball team for the school as second baseman, at the same time.

Born in Utica, N.Y.. the son of James and Mary McWenie, he came to Las Vegas at the age of 5, in 1886. His father had been in the West and enroute home stopped to visit his sister. Mrs. Maggie Holland. Mrs. Holland persuaded the older McWenie to send for his other sister, Etta, Mrs. W. T. Reed, and his boy, Edward. Edward returned temporarily to New York to attend first and second grades in Whitesboro. N.Y. prior to receiving the remainder of his education in Las Vegas at the public schools and at the Normal.

In April of 1901, before his graduation in June from the University. McWenie accepted employment at the First National Bank of Las Vegas as a collector. The bank.located in West Las Vegas, sent the young man out daily to collect money and drafts from depositors in the new town. He made his rounds on a bicycle. 

He worked for the bank from 1901 to 1919, when this bank and the San Miguel Bank consolidated. He was then with the combined institutions as a cashier until 1925. when the First National Bank of Lis Vegas closed its doors in a bank failure. McWenie then worked for 24 years as a salesman for the Pet Miik Sales Co. of St. Louis, Mo., covering all of New Mexico and Southern Colorado until he retired in June. 1949. 

From the first McWenie was delighted with this mountain country as he visited his Aunt Maggie Holland, at her 15 room summer resort hotel at the junction of Blue Canyon and Red Canyon in the Mineral Hill District

The hotel in the one-time mining community eventually burned. McWenie recalls driving a three-seated mountain spring wagon between Las Vegas and the hotel about 20 miles up in the scenic Sangre de Cristo mountain range, along the Tecolote River and into the "hills full of holes," dug by miners in the Mineral Hill boom days. 

One of his early more unpleasant recollections was the frightening fire on a windy, blustery day in 1892, when a whole block of the East Las Vegas business district was wiped out in wind-fanned flames. The fire started where the Canteen is now, wiped out Fetters Candy Store, Greenburg's clothing store and destroyed a whole block of buildings between old Center St., now Lincoln Ave., and Douglas Ave. The fire was finally controlled by the volunteer fire fighters, McWenie recalled.

Another scene that stands out in his memory is a parade of the notorious "Whitecaps," lawless men of the area who cut fences, stole cattle and terrorized this section of New Mexico until broken up by a Virginian named Thomas Smith, who sent many to the penitentiary. The parade, held at night, with the "Whitecaps" on horse-back, wearing pillowcases and sheets, took two hours to pass a given point, McWenie recalls. 

The biggest change in Las Vegas is the growth of the area, McWenie noted when interviewed. He remembers when what is now Columbia Ave. was on the outskirts of town, with the Wiley House on the northwest corner of Columbia, across from Library Park. the last house toward the rodeo grounds when Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders held their first reunion here.

The rodeo grounds were then located on Sixth St., between Baca and Friedman Ave. During the Rough Riders Celebration, attended by a large crowd of notable figures. including Gov. Otero and General Wood, a terrible rainstorm came, "wrecking everything." He is still amused as he remembers women hurrying home with faces streaked with colors from hats and veils as the tremendous crowd raced for shelter. 

In recalling the 1912 fight between Johnson and Flynn. McWenie said that the fight was stopped in the ninth round by a state policeman, for no reason at all. The consensus of opinion was that the fight was "framed," he said.

In 1910 Edward McWenie and Miss Muriel B. Hill were married in Idaho Springs. Colo. They had two children, Edward, born in Dec. 1911. and Margaret, born May 5, 1924, E. J. McWenie, Jr., is now supervising foreman for Mountain States Telephone Co.. in the installation department in Tucson, Ariz. He and his wife have two children. Fred and Pat. McWenie's daughter is now the wife of Dr. Henry C. Hosford, a physician of Alamogordo. They have two boys. Henry C.. Jr., and Stephen F. 

He and his wife lived in their home at 1103 Seventh at the cornet of Baer and Seventh, from 1920 until her death in 1948. He sold the house in 1949. Since that time he has lived temporarily in California. Southern New Mexico and Arizona, but be prefers the Las Vegas climate so he makes his home at the Elks Club in Las Vegas.

McWenie became city clerk in 1951 when Tom Kindell was mayor. He then served during two terms white Ivan Hilton was mayor. and half a year when Bob Wester was mayor. He retired from the city clerk's office in 1955. 

A member of of the Catholic Church. "Mr. Mac." as he is known to his countiess friends, has been a member of the BPO Elks No. 408 since 1906. He is a charter member of the Rotary Club, formed here in 1920, and was a member of the old Commercial Club with its offices in the Masonic Building.

As a sports fan, he plans to leave  March 13 to travel to Tucson to watch the Cleveland Indians in training for the next baseball season. This is his usual late winter recreation. 

There he also plans to watch the Boston Red Sox at Scottsdale, north of Phoenix; the Chicago Cubs in Mesa and the San Francisco Giants as they train in Phoenix. He will also watch as many others as he can work into his time schedule. He expects to see Ted Williams this year at Scottsdale. He has seen Musial several times and recalls seeing a "big game" in St. Louis at the Cards Park. 

After spending about a month in Arizona, "Mr. Mac" will return to Las Vegas, the best place in the world to live, he says, in spite of the unusually bad winter we are having. Always boosting this area, he never fails to assure anyone he meets that Las Vegas has a "summer climate that can't be beat anywhere!"

Ed McWenie, a pleasant elder statesmen of this town and dean of the Elk Club rooners, has one distinction that nobody can match. 

He was a member of match first first grade in a public school in East Las Vegas and was one of the 13 members of the first class at Highlands University, then the Normal University.

That first public school opened in 1897 in a building located on the present site of the Public Service Compiny of New Mexico, There were two teachers one for the big kids and one for the little ones. The teacher for the big boys and girls was A. Jones, later to become United States Senator Jones anc Secretary of the Interior. His wife taught the little students. 

The trouble was that the city ran out of money and school lasted four months. McWenie spent the rest of that year in the Brothers School in West Las Vegas. 

This sort of thing happened for the next five yours, McWenie allowed for variety by finishing some of the years at the Presbyterian Academy that operated on the present site of the Arts & Education Bullding on the Highlands campus. 

But by 1892 things were better. The first of three schoot buildings on the site of the present Douglas school was built that year and school lasted till spring.

But the school population grew and McWenie three years later and for three years afterward went to school on the upper floor of the City Hall. 

The Normal School when it opened in 1898 solved the problem for the city fathers and McWenie. Tuition was paid by the city and the City Hall was returned to city business.

McWenie graduated in 1901 with a liberal education and a well-earned reputation as a handy man with a football or baseball. In fact, along with his team-mates of 1901 he holds another distinction-that football team licked both the University of New Mexico, New Mexico A. and M. and everybody else. 

Mr. Mac, as he is known to his hundreds of friends got here in 1886 at the busy age of five. His two aunts had persuaded his father to move to Las Vegas. 

Las Vegas had its first cigar factory as a result of this. Mac's father built a state-wide business, his establishment being a building that stood on the site of the present Masonic building. But father got tired of the West and returned to New York state. Young McWenie remained with his aunt, Mrs. W.T. Reed

Mr. Mac. after graduation from Highlands, began work with the First National Bank and out of this grow another distinction. At the time of the first Cowboys Reunion in 1915 he was probably the only man in town who was a banker and a miller at the same time. He owned the Las Vegas Roller Mills (1908-19) at a time when a miller made flour in Las Vegas and was at the same time working for the Plaza Trust and Savings Bank. 

"As many as fifty wagons would sometimes be waiting at our platform for flour and other products", he recalls， "A favorite routine would be for folks fren Anton Chico to haul fruit to Mora, trade for wheat, and then come to the mill and trade for flour. Not much money in this, but everybody got what he wanted in the deal." 

It was about 1915, as he remembers it, that the first pavement was put down. He watched the operation from the Plazza bank. Vince Jones, the son of Senator Jones, was the city engineer in charge of the project. That pavement strip crossed the bridge, swung down to Douglas, turned Sixth and wound up at the Castaneda. 

And this in reverse order was the route of the early Reunion Parades as they worked their was toward the Rodeo Grounds on Hot Springs Boulevard. 

"I worked as a ticket-take along with Shillinglaw in those days for the rodeo and did other odd jobs. My main job, however, was before the shows when, working with Herman Ilfold and Bill Springer, I helped raise the prize money, no great task in those days. Just a couple of afternoons would do it." 

Mr. Mac might be able to claim another distinction but he doesn't know for sure. As an officer of Troop A of the National Guard, he took part in the first state-wide encampment held at Camp Luna. This was 1903. He just doesn't know if any other member of Troop A will be attending the Reunion this year. 

And he has another distinction that is derived from one of his stories. He is one of the two or three people who ever threw bake powder in the face of Edgar L Hewett, then president of the fledgling Normal and later to become one of the worlds greatest anthropologists. Hewett Hall on the Highlands campus has been named in his honor. 

The incident look place on an upper floor of the partly completed Springer Hall. The boys armed with samples of baking powder were waiting to initiate the next person through the door. They did squarely. That person was Hewett. That incident just about ended Mr. Macs' athletic career before it got started. but Hewett was a forgiving man.

But Mr. Mac's biggest distinction is that he is Mr. Mac. respected, kindly. tolerant, quick of wit, a man with an accurate and sympathetic memory of the youthful Las Vegas.
