The he entered the service of the United States under the following named officers and served as herein stated.

 

That he entered the service as a volunteer in a company of light horse commanded by Captain Conover does not recall the year but that it was in the spring after the enemy took the possession of New York City that the company was raised to guard the shores that he resided in the town of Freehold County of Monmouth in the state of New Jersey - that he entered the service he thinks in the month of April or May was stationed at Colts Neck the first summer the nature of the service was to guard against the Tories who frequently came across the bay from Staten Island and Long Island and pilfered horsed cattle sheep and carried as this deponent supposed to the enemy - that he was in the service during the summer for five seasons he was at home during the winter seasons and in the service summers - Colonel Holmes and General Forman commanded - that he was under the command of Captain William Remsen a part of the time.  That while he was under the command of Captain Remsen he was ordered to Philadelphia that he marched through Allentown and Trenton on the Delaware River and crossed the river and marched to Bristol where he met Congress retreating from Philadelphia and the company to which he belonged were pressed to guard Congress on their retreat and they marched back to Trenton from there to East town up the Delaware River from there to Moraviantown from there to Reading on the Schuylkill river - There we were dismissed by Congress and we marched back to Monmouth to guard the shores - That in the month of May the next year the enemy came down towards Monmouth and we were called out together with the militia.

That he was at Monmouth at the time of the battle at the place he went to Monmouth Court house and his company had left and he fell in the Colonel Morgans Riflemen and was drawn up in line of battle near John Richmonds Mill.  That they remained there some time that on the account of Gen Lee's disobeying orders they were not in the battle - after the battle the enemy retreated to New York.  That he was in the service three summers after that guarding the shores as above stated that he was called out in the spring and remained through the summer and until about winter of each year.  That he verily believes he was in the service during the five seasons as much or more than two years.  That he never had any written discharge.  That he was acquainted with Col Morgan of the Riflemen and Captain Lee of the Cavalry.  That Col. Holmes regiment of militia was with them some of the time of his service.  That he has a record of his age in his family Bible - that he will be seventy four years of age if he should live to the 19th of May next.

 

That since the Revolution he has lived in Charlestown, Montgomery County New York and Sullivan Madison Co and Parma Monroe Co and that he now resides in Farmersville Cattaraugus Co and that he knows of no person whose testimony he can provide who can testify to his service and that he has no documentary evidence.

 

He hereby relinquishes every claim whatever to a pension or annuity except the present and declares that his name is not on any pension roll of the agency of any state.  That there is no clergyman residing in the town of Farmersville to the deponents knowledge.  That Francis Baillet and Ezra B Strong are neighbors and can testify as to his character.

Mathias Lane a revolutionary pensioner of this town wishes to know whether he is entitled to receive bounty land - he never having rec. any - He has received a circular letter from some professed pension agent who proposes to give him valuable information respecting the same if he will send him $5.  Pensioners are frequently imposed upon in the way - The old man is poor and I presume the government does not intend to make such bounties subject to the heavy charges of speculating agents.  On the account I venture to trespass upon your valuable time

 

Respectfully yours
