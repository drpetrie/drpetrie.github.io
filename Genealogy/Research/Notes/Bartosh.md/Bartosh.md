# Marriage of Jakub Bartos and Anna Stara

Jakub Bartos married Anna Stara on February 20 1860 in "Audraz". The record is not in the records of the parish Albrechtice nad Vltavou where Udraz (the bride's village) is located, but it is recorded in the parish of Neznasov just south of there.  Here is a map:

Book 5 of the Parish of Neznasov in the Trebon Archives, on page 251 which is image number 259

Last entry on the page:

Maria Bartos born May 4, 1860

legitimate catholic female

house \# 31 in the village of Nezdasov

Otec- Jakub Bartos- pacholek from Nezdasov house 1,..... aw, heck the rest of the description is the same as for Frank.

Matka-this is also the same as for Frank.  But I am still working on the correct spelling for the mother's last name... Vavesna?

again godparents, priest and baba (midwife) all named

# Birth of Frantisek Bartos

Illegitimate child of Maria Bartos (Jakub’s sister)

Very cool that you are working in the archive. I am sure that you realize some of what I will tell you so please forgive me if I am explaining things you already know.


This is a record of illegitimate birth that was legitimized by a man.

Year 1861

Frantisek Bartos born March 11, baptized March 11, illegitimate, catholic male. Mother is Mari(e) Magdelena Bartos, podruh, Oudrazi čislo 3, Okres and Kraj Pisek, daughter of the deceased Frantisek Bartos, chalupnik,  from Albrechtice č. 31, okr. Tyn kr. Budejovice mother Veronica nee Bartos from Albrechtice 12.

Godparents are Jan K.(Kantujk??? this is wrong-he was signing his own name) chalupnik form Oudraz house 6 and Katerina Hrdlickova from Albrectice house 4.

Later this fellow Jan Rudolf came along and married poor little Marie Magdelena on September 29, 1863 making this child legitimate. Marriage is recorded in Tom. \[book\] III \[or is it VI?\] fol. \[folio=page\]  7  

His information is Jan Rudolf, obuvnik (shoemaker) from Oudraz, son of deceased Martin Rudolf and Anna Horazdovsky? and then my guess is "přihlasil se za otce to ho to ditky \_\_\_\_ prjmi vepseti řadak" which means something like "he claimed to be the father of his children".  If you think I am reading this you give me too much credit, I am using google translate. 

Mr. Rudolf can sign his own name and it looks to me that he is rather proud of that.

You can read these records if you learn keywords like:

Brezna=March

č.= čislo=house (comes before the house number which is the "address")

dcera=daughter

\+ means deceased

syn=son

copul.=copulatum=latin for marriage

Headings on the page are imortant to know:

rok a den= year and day

Nro.domu= number of house

Gmeno pokteneho=name of the christened

The little chart headings are katholik, protestant, male, female, legit and illegit

otec=father

mater=mother

and all that bla-bla about witnesses, priest and midwife...

There are some odd things we all learn about the format of Czech records and language:

Do you already know that -ova is an ending for all the females with that surname? It is not a different surname. Bartos/Bartosova

Since they make the colulmns ridiculously narrow they break words in middle and continue on next line.

Czech is known for changing the endings of words based on the grammatical use of the word or name.  Thus the parent "Frantisky" is NOT Frantiska, it is Frantisek. y kind of makes it an adjective?  Maybe you know more about nominative usage? other interesting endings include -a -e -neho etc.

The handwriting is called kurrent and it is tricky.

The records can be in latin, german and czech, or my personal favorite... a mix of these.


If you are going to continue to learn the records and want help along the way I have many tools I can share.

I am attaching charts and words lists. Sorrry the wordlist will need to be rotated--- I have a new printer....

Please don't hesitate to ask.  This is one of the functions that I  have at CGSI.  Just a bit of research for folks. Only difference is that they usually have to pay for my time.  But I consider you family.

What specifically are you after in the archive? Perhaps you are looking for the father of Jacob?

Sorry this is so long.  I am aware that men don't like my wordiness.

Hey there.  Thanks again for locating the Bartos birth and marriage records.  Never thought I would see those.

I have been exploring the parish records a little in hopes of finding any other information about the Bartos. Here is an 1861 Oudraz record for a Frantisek Bartos. I see mention of Maria Bartos, Frantiske Bartos and Veronika Bartushka. But I’m not sure exactly what I’m looking at. Any chance you could interpret this?

# Birth of Anna Stara

Good morning Darren

You did find an Anna Stara.  The second entry is for her illegit birth to an Alzbeta, daughter of Jakub Staranyho.  If you look at the other record referred to just below this birth in the index--you will find the infant's death.

<https://digi.ceskearchivy.cz/5866/39/1351/1605/88/0>

"St" often looks like one letter.They did not "close the "a" after that and remember that the "r" kinda ends up looking like a "w".

Check out this neat tool for visualizing kurrent script:

So I think I found the index entry for Anna Stara (b 1826) (Jacob Bartosh wife) in the records for Slavětice 

<https://digi.ceskearchivy.cz/5870/123/1963/1563/46/0>

But I cannot locate her birth entry within Book 4. Seems it should be this page.

If you have a minute could you see if she is on the second link?

# Birth of Anna Stara

Birth of Anna Stara

I looked in parish Albrechtice n. Vlt.

I looked in parish Neznasov because her father's town was mentioned as Ujezd.

I looked in parish Tyn nad Vltavou which is the parish of Veronika's village Bohunice (please correct me earlier spelling) 

That is where I found this birth record for Anna Stara in Mala Strana:

# Marriage of Frantisek Bartos and Veronika Bartuska 

<https://digi.ceskearchivy.cz/2009/13/1230/1167/136/0>

Not as easy to read, is it?

Aujezda and Ujezd refer to the same place.  I have learned to be rather lax with spellings.  All the villages have both a Czech name and a German name.  And each time they write the name it has grammatical modifiers.

Marriage of Frantisek Bartos and Veronika

I don't know if I will be able to read it either.  But I have seen much worse, too.

Date January 27, 1824, Albrech(ce?) house 31, Frans (Franciscus is the latin) widowed, chalupnik, of Albrech. house 31. Staw column says "vdova" again (widowed).  Veronika daughter of deceased Vita Bartusky Albr house 12 and Veronika M\_\_chovy \[in record for Jacob birth the name rather looks like Manchova\] daughter of  Alb. house 20.  She is listed as svobodna (free or unmarried=first marriage)  They list the estate they were subject to in this record but I don't know all the estate names.  Perhaps Nejdosov? Ah, I think that says Neznasov. here is a list of villages that are part of that estate:

<https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044018868539&view=1up&seq=392>

Re: Birth of Anna Stara.  Her father is Matej of Mala Strana \[parents Jakub and  Veronika, she has a "vulgo" name that is something like Paterjk? they are both from Slavetice\] Her mother is Marianna daughter of Josef Vovesna of Bohunice and Veronika from Netechovice.


Yes, my Riha was from Velky Vir.  But I looked for your peeps in that area and did not find them.  Plus, unfortunately, my Rihas had a vulgo name as well, Hanzla.  I have such a mixed bunch of records with the Riha/Hanzla line that I am having a professional look at them.   I rather suspect that our connection lies in the area we are looking at now, instead.

# Marriage of Matej Stara and Marie Vovesna

I believe this to be the record despite the different maiden name

<https://digi.ceskearchivy.cz/8119/29/1339/1769/99/0>

well and so....Matej's parents are correct and Marie's parents' FIRST names are correct, but they give Marie a maiden name of Blazka. I believe this may be another vulgo name like we saw in the record of Anna Stara's birth. I was hoping we would not run into vulgo names because they can confuse one so quickly.  I would ask that  you read this short blog post regarding vulgo names:

<http://czechgenealogy.nase-koreny.cz/2012/11/surnames-after-roof.html>

# Birth of Anna Stejskal

I think I found Matej’s wife’s birth record.  Anna Stejskal

<https://digi.ceskearchivy.cz/2007/194/942/1512/83/0>

I’m trying to hone my skills. It is thanks to Matej and Anna that we got here!  :)

# Birth of Matej Bartos

Is this a birth record for Matej Bartos?  I believe he is the brother of Jakub. It was an obituary from Matej's wife Anna Stejskal that originally led me to believe the Bartos were from Udraz.

<https://digi.ceskearchivy.cz/2007/91/1258/1456/59/0>

# Death of Matej Stara

Is this the death of Matej Stara?

<https://digi.ceskearchivy.cz/5869/42/1226/2167/71/0>

That is all I am going to do for today.  I have been up since 4:30.  I realize that these are difficult to read and there are some questions that are brought up.  I will help with transcription but it has been a lot of time already today.  It will give you a chance to struggle a bit and figure out what you are looking at.  Frankly, because I am not taking good notes and you have at least three parishes and even more villages I am getting very confused.  But you be my second eyes and tell me what does not look right.  And take your time with each record.  Don't jump so quickly to the next generation.

Just a note:  We are getting closer.  In this parish I recognize my great-grandmother's maiden name AND her mother's maiden name. Those names are Sirovatka and Spina.  This map represents how close their births were to Albrechtice and Tyn n. Vltavou:

I will work on finding more.  I had already looked for Anna's birth but did not find it in Udraz.  I will need to have another go.  And now, of course, there are others to look for.
