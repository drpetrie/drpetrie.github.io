I'm descended from, and desiring to know the parentage and ancestry of, Mary (Polly) Russell, born December 5, 1773, in CT. She married Samuel Cooper, born September 16, 1774 in RI, sometime in the 1790s.

There children were;

1\. Charles Ira Cooper 1799-1849, died in Ceres PA m. Betsy, who was born Candaigua NY and died 1898

2\. Mercy Cooper born Nov 1802 in NY, and died February 19 1860. She married Jacob Reckhow.

3\. Cyrus W Cooper born 1804 in NY, and died April 29 1888 in Ceres, PA.

4\. Margaret Cooper born 1806, and died May 18 1886. She married Lister Hargraves.

5\. Russell Cooper was born Jan 1808, and died 6 Sept 1866 in Ceres. PA.

6\. Mary Cooper was born 1812, and died 1860.

7\. Theron Cooper (through whom I'm descended) born August 23 1813 in Darmouth, NY, and died 1900 in Annin, in Potter Co, PA. He married Sophia A Mead June 1840, daughter of John Mead & Eva Sisson, of Bolivar, Allegany Co, NY.

8\. Silas Cooper born 1820, and died 1901 in Potter Co, PA. He married Pamela (Mrs Silas Cooper).

Mary (Polly) (Russell) Cooper died May 10, 1857, and is buried alongside her husband Samuel Cooper, who died Oct 12, 1857, in the Annin Creek cemetery in Annin / Turtlepoint PA, near Port Allegheny PA. (There is a war of 1812 marker beside his grave). They may have been of Washington CO. NY, as well as in the area of Farmington NY for a time.

It is believed (by susan Valis from info I've found on internet, and I'd love to have verification on this Cooper line as well)that Samuel Cooper is a son of Peter Cooper born ca 1740 and wife Betsey believed to be living in North Providence, RI in 1760's to at least 1774. Pete and Betsy Removed to Killingly, CT probably during the Revolution and still there in 1795. Their children: Owen b. 1768; (my) Samuel m. Polly -----; Phoebe m. Richard Durham;

Lucinda m. William BURRIS, Lovina m. ------ LITTLE, and Jerusha m.------ADAMS, prob d. Killingly, CT.

This Peter believed to be the Peter b. ca 1738 to Peter and Hebzibeth (CHUBB) at Cumberland, RI and believed to be descendant of 1Thomas COOPER through his son 2 Nathaniel and 3 Nathaniel.

A couple thoughts on Russell ancestry - Charles, Charles Ira, or just Ira, perhaps name of Mary Russell's dad? Besides Mary, Mercy is another name for Mary I believe, as is Polly, so perhahps born Mercy? Well, a stretch.

Also, Theron, from whom I'm descended, such an uncommon name, perhaps a clue as well, to family origins of Mary Russell's. (an odd observation - either bright blue eyes seem to flow through the recessive genes of either this Russell or Cooper ancestry).

These are all the details I can think of, and I hope it is helpful to someone researching the same lines, and, that someone might have information, which will solve the mystery of Mary Russell's ancestry, and also perhaps confirm the ancestry of Samuel Cooper. Thank you - Andrew.
