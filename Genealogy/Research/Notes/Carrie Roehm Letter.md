Dear Herman,

Received your letter and glad that you are still an old bachelor and in good health. I know it must be lonesome all by your lonesome. But never mind you may have luck and sell the place then you can take a trip out here to see us for a while that would be great and would be a big change for you. We are having real winter around here, very cold and lots of rain instead of snow, today is ground hog day so they say we will have six more weeks of rain and snow but he will have to show me.

So now Herman you have another brother in law (Marie and Roy Newman). Well I sure was surprised but do hope they get along that is the main thing and as long as he has work.

So now Herman drop us a line some day and keep in the best of health as we are all real well around here again grandfather is fine again so now a big hug and kiss all for yourself.

Lovingly yours

Aunt Carrie
