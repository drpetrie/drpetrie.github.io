Robert Helbig notes from Linda Klavano

From Linda Klavano - I spoke to my Aunt Clara this summer. She is still living in Texas and recently celebrate her 91st birthday. She is still living on her own and very alert. I'd always wondered why she and my mother graduated high school the same year (they were two years apart in age). Clara stayed home a year and took care of Robert Helbig during his final year of life. He was bed ridden and needed bandages on his legs changed and dressed. I didn't understand what he died from. Clara shared it was very difficult for her as a 13 yr. old to handle his declining health. She was taking him soup for lunch and when she entered his room he was dead. 

The researcher also included the following information:

Note:  All other records show Helbig for Robert’s surname. Mrs. Ema Rights (sic), being a Lutheran, promises to have baptized, and raised in the Catholic Church, all the children she may have by her new husband Robert Elbeigh.  She promises also, to let all the children who Mr. Robert Elbeigh, already has to practice freely the teaching, and commandments of their Catholic Religion and the Catholic Apostolic Roman Church.

The surname Pitry is probably spelled phonetically in Spanish so look for spelling as Petry.  Any questions, please write. I think my friend might have Baptism book.  I did check my other Santa Fe Marriage book (ends in 1889) and don't find anything that looks like it might be Helbig) 

I got incredibly ambitious this week researching Helbigs in New Mexico and contacted some volunteer NM researchers ... and I hit on some great info:

23 May 1901 – I married Robert Elbeigh (widowed from Paulina Metzel, legitimate son of Robert Elbeigh and Carolina Luiza Perriganan, both deceased, from Santa Fe) with Ema Buhron (widowed from Charley Rights, legitimate daughter of Hans Buhron, deceased, and Carolina Fruzze, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Witnesses:  Valentine Herbert, Mrs. Louise Weiler and Miss Gertie W. Helbig

The "Note" was put in by the transcriber.  Keep in mind the priests and church clerks wrote the records, and wrote what they "heard" and that didn't always mean they knew how to spell.

2 Apr 1902 – Published two banns.  I married \*John Pitry\*, single, legit s/ Matthew Pitry and Catherine Riel, from Buena Vista, Minesota (sic), with

\*Gertrude Helbeig\*, single, legit d/ Robert Helbeig and Pauline Metzel, deceased, from Santa Fe, Wit/ Fred Helbeig and Louisa Wheler (Wheeler),

Off/ Very Reverend Anthony Fourchégu, Vicar General and Rector.\[END\]

Because of what Beret provided, I initially I thought Robert arrived in America with his wife Pauline and two daughters in Aug 1881. The 1910 Census also had Robert arriving in America in 1881 (married); but the 1920 Census has his immigration year of 1880 (single).

I can not find any info that supports Robert came to America with a wife and two daughters. I have located a Robert Helbig who taught industrial arts at the Albuquerque Indian School in the early 1880s ... and a Mrs. Helbig worked in the kitchen.

There is also the reference in The Albuquerque Daily Citizen in 1902 about a women "a health seeker" who died while she was staying in Robert Helbig's home with her husband and son. There is also another newspaper article from 1902 of Gertrude Helbig marriage to John Petri.
