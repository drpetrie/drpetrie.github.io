IV.

That the said decedent Matthew Spence and this

plaintiff were at the time of the death of said decedent and

had been for twenty-eight years prior thereto, co-partners;

that as such co-partners they were engaged in the business

of buying and selling farming land and farming the same, and

buying and selling all kinds of live stock and raising the

same. That, their respective interests in said co-partner-

ship were equal and each owned an undivided one-half thereof.

That they carried on their said co-partnership business under

the firm name and style of “M. & T. Spence” though some-

times designated as "Spence Bros."

(4)

V.

That at the time of the death of said decedent, he

and this plaintiff owned together as such co-partners, cer-

tain real estate situated in said Butte County and in Sutter

County, California, and which, as such co-partners, they were

engaged in farming; that the said real estate is particular-

ly described as follows, to wit:

FIRST: These certain parcels situated in Butte

County, California, Section Five (5); N. E. 1/4 and S. 1/2 of 

Section 6; Township 19, North, Range 2 East, containing 1107

acres, more or less. The S. E. 1/4, Section 21, and S. 1/2,

Section 22, Township 17 North, Range 2 East, containing 480

acres. Lots 3 and 4 of Block 40 of the Town of Gridley, ac-

cording to the map thereof.

SECOND: Those certain parcels situate in Sutter

County, California. The W. 1/2 of N. E. 1/4 and W. 1/2 of S. E.

1/4 Section 27; W. 1/2 Section 27; E. 1/2 Section 28, Town-

ship 17 North, Range 2 East, containing 820 acres.

That portions of said lands were convoyed to plain-

tiff and said decedent under their partnership name of “M. &

T. Spence," and other portions to them under the individual

names, me although certain portions of said land appear to

belong to said plaintiff and said decedent as tenants in com-

mon, it in fact and in truth all belonged to them as such

co-partners and was owned and held by them as such partners

and used by them for such partnership purposes and belonged

to the said co-partnership.

(5)


----

VI.

That said co-partnership at the death of said de-

ceased, did not possess or own any money or other securities

and no personal property except a small amount of work stock

and farming machinery used in farming said lands, and of a

total value not exceeding $2000, That the same is all nec-

essary and indispensable for the farming of said lands, and

could not be disposed of for a sum exceeding $1500., as it

is all old and of little value. And its use is absolutely

necessary to the farming of said premises or any part thereof.

VII.

That ever since the death of said decedent this

plaintiff, as surviving partner of said co-partnership, has

been and still is, in possession of all said property

real and personal, carrying it on and endeavoring as such

surviving partner, to close up the business of said co-part-

nership.

VIII.

That at the death of said decedent the said co-

partnership was largely indebted to various parties; that

the aggregate amount of such indebtedness at that time, was

the sum of $41,000, the principal item of which was an in-

debtedness of $31,000 from said decedent and this plaintiff

to the German Savings and Loan Society San Francisco; the

payment of which was secured by a mortgage upon said real

estate.

(6)


----

That all of said indebtedness was co-partnership

indebtedness snd incurred by the said co-partnership in con-

ducting its said partnership business.

That all of said indebtedness, including said sum

go secured by mortgage is due and unpaid. That this plain-

tiff in conducting said partnership business since the death

of said decedent, has contracted other indebtedness and ob-

ligations in the care, conduct, and management of said part-

nership business, That in each of the three harvests suc-

ceeding the death of said decedent, the crops on said co-part-

nership lands have from natural causes and without any fault

or negligence of this plaintiff, been a comparative failure,

and to such an extent that the business was net remunerative

and the proceeds of said crops was not sufficient to

pay the interest on said co-partnership indebtedness, taxes,

on the property and the current expenses of said partnership

business. The price of all farm products raised by said

partnership during that entire time, has been low. That the

said partnership now owes said debt to the German Savings

and Loan Society, and there is now due on the same the sum

of $33,431, which will be increased by the accruing interest

and the said co-partnership is further indebted in the sum

$23,000. This sum covers not only indebtedness existing

at the time of the death of said deceased, but indebtedness

incurred since his death by this plaintiff as such surviving

partner. It is owing to various persons, and is mostly evi-

denced by promissory notes, which are bearing interest. The

principal items are the sum of $10,000 due to the Rideout

(7)


----

Bank and the sum of $12,000 due to A. Schwartz of Gridley.

That the total amount of said indebtedness now outstanding

against said copartnership is the sum of $55,431. That the

same is all due and the holders thereof are pressing for

payment.

That the said personal property is wholly inade-

quate to its payment; that it is all partnership indebted-

ness of said copartnership of M. & T. Spence and is properly

chargeable on and is a lien upon the said real estate, the

property of said partnership. That there is no means by

which your plaintiff can settle up the said partnership and

pay said debts, except by a sale of the said real estate

and using the proceeds thereof for the purpose of paying said

indebtedness.

IX.

That in and by the terms of said last will of said

decedent, the plaintiff herein is given a life estate in all

of said real estate and at his death all of said real estate

is devised to the said defendant, No. 1, Wm. Spence, who is

as aforesaid, a brother of said deceased, and is now of the

are of 50 years, to have and to hold during the term of his

natural life, and at his death, a portion of said real estate

is devised in fee to the defendants. Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive,

and all the balance of said real estate is devised to the

defendants Nos. 2 to 18 inclusive, in fee.

(8)


----

X.

That in the matter of the estate of said decedent

the said defendant, Wm. Spence as executor aforesaid, duly

published notice to creditors. The first publication of

said notice having been made on the 13th day of March, 1890,

and the time in which creditors had to present their debts,

has long since expired. That no part of said indebtedness

either the mortgage debt or the balance, was presented as a

claim against the said estate of said decedent, but the said

creditors for their payment, look to and rely solely upon

this plaintiff, as such surviving partner, and their lien

upon said partnership property and their right to subject

it to the payment of said partnership debts. And in order

to pay said indebtedness it is necessary that the whole of

said land be sold for that purpose. That the value of the

said real estate is little, If any more, than the amount of

said indebtedness, and sold at forced sale will not realize

more than sufficient to pay said debts.

WHEREFORE, the said plaintiff prays that a judgement

and decree may be entered herein; that the said real estate

was and is partnership assets of the said copartnership of

M. and T. Spence. That the said sun of $56,431 is valid and

subsisting indebtedness of the sald copartnership, and that

it be adjudged to be a lien upon said real estate, and that

said real estate be ordered to be sold and the proceeds of

the sale be applied to the payment of said partnership in-

debtedness and that a Commissioner be appointed by this

Court to make such sale. And that it be ordered that

(9)


----

said Commissioner give the same notice of sale as is prescrib-

ed by and in cases of sales of real estate under execution,

and that after such sale, said Commissioner report the same

to the court for the approval by the Court thereof. And

upon such approval, the said sale to become final and the

said Commissioner to execute a deed thereof to the purchaser,

or purchasers, and the said defendants and each of them, be

barred and foreclosed of all right, claim or interest in

the said premises and every part thereof.

And that by the decree of this Court it may be pro-

vided that any of the parties hereto, whatever may be their

relations to the other parties or to said property or to any

part of it, may be authorized and allowed to bid for and

purchase any or all of the property so ordered sold; and

that in said decree it may be provided that any conveyance

made under said decree, shell vest in the party or parties

so purchasing and receiving a conveyance or conveyances, the

title in fee simple to the land so purchased by him or them,

free and clear of any legal or equitable rights therein or

thereto, of any and all parties to this action;

And that the plaintiff may have such further and

equitable relief as in the premises may seem meet.
