**MARY AND JOHN — 1630**

**Mas­ter Thomas Squeb**

Sailed from Ply­mouth, 20 March 1630.

The day of the sail­ing was the Sat­ur­day before Palm Sunday.


Landed Nan­tas­ket, Mass­a­chu­setts, 30 May, 1630.

400 tons.

140 pas­sen­gers

40 — 50 crewmen

Ship owned by Roger Ludlow

The ship was sup­pose to land at the Charles river but Capt. Squeb refused to nav­i­gate the Boston Har­bor, prob­a­bly because of its islands, sand­bars and shoals. He had the pas­sen­gers dis­em­bark at Nan­tas­ket Point.

June 1630 — John Winthrop sent for Capt. Squeb at Nan­tas­ket, where the “Mary and John” lay. He did not record what was said. “\[John\] Winthrop seemed to think he had ‘ended \[the\] dif­fer­ence between him \[Capt. Squeb\] and the pas­sen­gers’, in token of which Cap­tain Squeb gave the order for a salute of five guns in the govenor’s hon­our and it was said that Squeb later paid com­pen­sa­tion to \[Roger\] Lud­low.” \[Dorset Pil­grims, Frank Thistleth­waite, p.76\]

There is no offi­cial pas­sen­ger list of the Mary *&* John.
