Jarvis Strong trip 2001

Every year there seems to be one to three peo­ple, groups, or fam­i­lies that are vis­it­ing Eng­land and would like to visit the Chard­stock Strong Cot­tage. This cot­tage was built in the late 1500s, likely for Strongs who later moved to Chard (about 4 miles away).

The Strong Cot­tage was built by the Chard­stock Manor Estates. The cur­rent Lord of the Manor is Jonathan Mil­ford who lives in Manor Home in Chard­stock. The Strong Cot­tage was reha­bil­i­tated some years ago (around 1993). Jarvis Strong’s project to help the rehab pro­vided $10,000, which was a bit less than 10% of the total. It did indi­cate Amer­i­can inter­est in the project, though, and pro­vided the impe­tus for the own­ers to com­plete the cot­tage rehab. The cot­tage is presently rented by Joe Har­ri­son as his home.
