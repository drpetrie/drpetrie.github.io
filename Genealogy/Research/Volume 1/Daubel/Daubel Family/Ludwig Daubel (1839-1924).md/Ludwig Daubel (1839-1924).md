# Ludwig Daubel (1839-1924)

Ludwig Daubel (b. 1839) was the head of the Daubel family that came to America. He was a blacksmith in Bonfeld and he had to apply to leave the country. He had 3,000 marks at that time which is roughly $20,000 USD today. They left Germany because of the boys and the strict Military (army). They wanted more freedom and safety for their children.
