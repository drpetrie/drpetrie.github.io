The following was written in 1971 as part of a Senior Citizen spotlight.

Herman recalled driving a horse to Milan where they did most of their shopping. What could not be obtained there was gotten by taking a train to Spokane from Milan.

His first school days were spent at the Muhle School that used to stand on the Coldanow placo, across the road from the Henry Hoener place.

Herman said that on some days there was no recess because cougars came a close that it was not safe to let the children outside.

Next he went to the Deer Creek School, walking three miles each way.

The younger children finished school at Milan, with Herman driving a team and picking up the other children, for which he received $15.00 a month. You might say this was our first school bus.

He first worked out for the Spokane Lumber Company at Milan, then for Edwards and Bradford at Elk. Later he worked in the woods until 1930 at which time he left here and spent a few years working on a farm on the coast.

Herman returned home to marry Theresa Strong in 1937. He worked in the woods for awhile and farmed.

This union was blessed with three boys and three girls.

While still farming he left the woods and worked at the Aluminum Plant of America at Mead, as a heavy duty man and stayed on to work for Kaiser Aluminum for 15 years.

Now retired, Herman raises a few calves and pigs.

For enjoyment he and Theresa attend the Deer Park Auction Sale and fish.

This year Herman and Theresa's six children and 13 grandchildren were all home for Christmas.

He died of a heart attack in 1977.  He was a quiet man.
