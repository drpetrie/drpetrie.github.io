He met his wife Marie when she came out West to visit her Aunt. They had eleven children! In those days there was no doctor near so their neighbor, Mrs. Staley was midwife for all eleven children.

Charles was a stern man. They would be doing farm work and when my Grandpa would pass out Charles would just drag him into the shade until he came to. 

Charles, farmed and did blacksmith work for a living. They raised apples, grapes and other fruits and grain for their own use and to sell. They ground their own grain and cornmeal for flour. He would take his threshing machine around the neighborhood and thresh grain for neighbors. They also had a small sawmill to saw lumber for the buildings on the Daubel farms. They would go up to the Elk mill pond in the winter and saw blocks of ice and store it in the icehouse in sawdust. This they would use for cooling food and for ice cream. They shared the ice also with neighbors. They raised their own meats and vegetables, fruits, grains, and had their own milk and poultry products. They were very self sufficient.
