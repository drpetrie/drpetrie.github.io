The Helbig line comes from Dresden, Germany which is near the Czech Republic.

I was able to locate the birth certificate of Robert Helbig along with his marriage certificate to Pauline Metzelt.  It appears the Robert and Pauline immigrated to the US in 1881. Their ship manifest shows two daughters.  They lived in Santa Fe, NM by 1883. However by the time of the 1900 census there is no record of the first two daughters. However I cannot find any death records for them.  

Robert remarried after Pauline died. The family legend is that the new wife was not very nice and didn’t like kids. He divorced her and the whole Helbig family moved to MN when Gertrude married John Petri and moved to MN.

Robert has one of the most colorful histories I uncovered of all my ancestors.
