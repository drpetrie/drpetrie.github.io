# Robert Helbig (1852-1937)

Robert was born in Dresden, Germany in 1852 and immigrated to the US in 1881. The ship manifest lists him as a baker. 

He settled in Santa Fe, NM where he worked at an Indian school in Albuquerque.  The following is an excerpt from the Indian School Book: 

Opening of the fall term, in October, 1882, found the Indians favorable to sending their children to this school, and succeeded in securing an attendance of eighty-six pupils, sixty-five boys and twenty-one girls.

Additional accommodations had to be immediately made for such an unexpected increase in numbers. Rough wooden structures were thrown up, but to make their quarters more comfortable the boys built an adobe wall on the out side, a la Indian, which makes them feel quite at home.

The following is the corps of instructors :

R. W. D. Bryan, superintendent; Miss Mariette Wood, Miss Lita A. Butler and Mrs. L. F. Tibbals, assistant teachers; Mr. Robert Helbig, industrial teacher; Miss M. H. Patten, matron; Miss L. H.

Patten, assistant matron; Miss Salome Verbeck, seamstress; Miss Clara E. Chaddock, laundress; Mrs. Robert J. Helbig, cook.

The United States does not pay sufficiently for the labor performed and expenses necessarily incurred, consequently much of it has to be made up by the generosity of the people. This school is in good hands, and should be sustained by a philanthropic and generous public.

Nothing pleases the scholars more than to see visitors at their school, and the urbane superintendent takes great pains that his visitors receive proper attention.

1882-10-23 - The kitchen, under the direct charge of Miss Patten, is neat and clean, and the store room connected with it is filled with all sorts of food, the largest portion of course being light, fine bread, baked in an adobe oven at the school, by Robert Helbig, his wife Mrs, Helbig, being the cook.

By the time of the 1900 census it appears his first wife Pauline had died as well has his two daughters that were born in Germany. However I cannot find any death records for the two girls.  

Rumor is his second wife was mean. He seems to have remarried in Santa Fe. The priest notes for the marriage says that: Mrs. Emma Rights, being a Lutheran, promises to have baptized, and raised in the Catholic Church, all the children she may have by her new husband Robert Helbig.  She promises also, to let all the children who Mr. Robert Helbig, already has to practice freely the teaching, and commandments of their Catholic Religion and the Catholic Apostolic Roman Church.

He went to Minnesota after his daughter Gertrude got married to John Petri. She was a mail order bride. Robert suffered in his old age. There are a lot of interesting stories about Robert. He was a baker at the Albuquerque Indian School. He was hurt by a bull. He worked as a cook in a logging camp in Minnesota and was stabbed in the back by a man with a knife.

There are several newspaper articles that provide a very colorful picture of Robert.

1889-07-05 - Robert Helbig filed charges in 'Squire Padilla's court yesterday against Antonio Borrego, whom he found in his cherry tress having a 4th of July picnic with the fruit. Helbig ordered him away, when Borrego assaulted him with a stone and skinned up his face considerably.

1889-07-06 - Antonio Borrego and Antonio Borrego

y Gonzales are quite different persons. It was the latter that had the difficulty with Robert Helbig over the cherries and not the former. This correction is cheerfully made at the request of Antonio Borrego.

1891-07-21 - Robert Helbig discovered a large snake in his orchard in upper Santa Fe yesterday afternoon and succeeded in capturing his snakeship and he is now bottled up on exhibition at Ireland's drug store. The animal has the marks of a rattier, but its candle extremity is minus either the rattles or button and opinions differ as to its species.

1898-08-17 - A Little Girl's Distressing Death.

About 7 o'clock last night, bright and amiable little Barbara, the 10-year old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Helbig, residing on eastern Manhattan street, was abruptly seized with violent cramps in the stomach, followed by convulsions, and, in spite of the best medical skill and the untiring efforts of parents and friends, died in great agony about midnight. Dr. Sloan made an autopsy this forenoon and arrived at the conclusion that death was caused by strychnine, which the child had secured in some unaccountable way from a bottle of the poison that was in the house. The autopsy was held at the request of the father. The funeral, in charge of Undertaker Wagner, will take place at the cathedral at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning and the little body will be buried in Rosario cemetery.

1900-03-24 - About 12 o'clock at night the greenhouse on the place of Robert Helbig at Santa Fe, was totally destroyed by fire.

1900-08-14 - Robert Helbig, the dairyman, was assaulted by a vicious bull Saturday evening and had a narrow escape for his life, His left arm was broken in two places.

1901-05-23 - Robert Helbig and Mrs. Emma Reitz of Philadelphia, were married this morning at 6 o'clock at the cathedral by Vicar General Fourchegu. This evening a reception will be tendered the couple at the Helbig residence on Manhattan avenue. A dance will follow the reception which will also be birthday celebration for Mr. Helbig.

1902-06-04 - Mrs. Cora M. Fisch, a health seeker, died last night at the home of Robert Helbig, where she had been living with her husband and only son.

1905-11-21 - WOODSMAN IS STABBED

Crazy Lumberjack Hurls Sharp Butcher Knife at a Comrade.

Robert Helbig, a woodsman employed at the Olson camp near Dawson City, arrived in the city this afternoon and was continued at St. Anthony's hospital to receive treatment for an ugly gash in the back of his neck, which according to his story was received at the camp yesterday afternoon. Helbig claims that a woodsman working in the same camp threw a large butcher knife at him and that the knife struck him in the neck, inflicting a painful though not dangerous wound. He does not know the name of the man who threw the knife but states that there was no provocation for the act and that the perpetrator has been captured and is held at the camp awaiting the arrival of the authorities, who have been notified.

Helbig says that the camp was about to break up and that he was gathering a number of dishes together in the dining room when the other man emerged from the kitchen carrying a butcher knife and that immediately afterwards he felt the knife strike him and the blood started to shoot from the wound.

The perpetrator attempted to make his escape, but after a chase in which several shots were fired at the escaping man the latter was halted and taken back to the camp.

1918-04-11 - Mrs. Ammond Jacobson and Mrs. M. A. Djonne entertained us with two Norwegian dances. Robert Helblg entertained with songs, two of which, “America” and “Silent Night”, he sang in German aw well as English

 

1918-10-04 - The home of Robert Helbig was destroyed by fire last Sunday and Mr. Helbig was seriously burned. He was rushed to Dr. Neal who dressed his wounds. Mr. Helbig at this writing is doing nicely.

Robert appeared in the “Liberty Township History” book. Some of the info provided there includes”

Robert Helbig helped build some of the roads in Liberty Township.  He helped lay the corduroy on the Long Lake road.  This corduroy is still on this road.  IT was found when some work was recently done on the road.  Robert was one of the men who helped move a house for George Elliot.  This was told about in the story of George Elliot.  Robert was always doing work of some kind much of it for his neighbors.

Later on he lived in Fred's house on the south shore of Long Lake.  This house burned down and he rebuilt it.  His granddaughters used to come out to visit him.  They became acquainted with a neighbor girl, Edith Hayes.  They often went boarding together on Long Lake.

Robert Helbig always had a garden.  He also planted many flowers around his house and yard.  Years later one could find lots of those flowers in the area where the house had been.  One of his favorites was Sweet William, which bloomed year after year.

One time when Robert had been visiting his daughter, Francis Sundh, he had started for home.  It was getting late and so it was dark before he had gone very far.  He headed for home through the woods around the west end of Long Lake.  He got too far to the west and got lost.  Someone heard him hollering and they went to look for him.  They found him and took him home.  It was cold weather, so it was good they found him.

George Elliot - Since there was no house on the part where the barn and other farm buildings were, George decided to move the house from the north part.  Alvin and Glen Jacobson recall the story that their father told about the house moving.  George got a group of neighbors together, including Rutherford Hayes with his team of horses.  Ole and Amund Jacobson, Lewis Hanson, Robert Helbig, Charlie Sundh, and probably others helped.  They put logs under the house to use as rollers.  These had to be even and kept even under the house as they rolled it.  Rutherford used a stump puller to pull the house.  They put large logs across a stream, so they could cross it.  As the house rolled along they had to make sure the logs rolled evenly.  As they crossed the stream, old Mr. Helbig fell in.  Someone grabbed him by the shirt collar and pulled him out, but that didn't deter him, he kept on helping wherever he could.  They finally go the house over the creek and to where they wanted it to be.  This house had a kitchen and living room downstairs, with the bedrooms upstairs.  George had a porch built on the side of the kitchen entry.

When Robert could no longer live alone, his daughters took turns keeping him in their homes and caring for him.  He was living with Maria Klasen, when he passed away on December 17, 1937 at the age of 87.  (This information was in the "Death Records of Liberty Township").  Herman Klasen reported his death to the clerk of Liberty Township.  Robert was buried in Bemidji.

I received this story from Linda Klavano: I spoke to my Aunt Clara this summer. She is still living in Texas and recently celebrate her 91st birthday. She is still living on her own and very alert. I'd always wondered why she and my mother graduated high school the same year (they were two years apart in age). Clara stayed home a year and took care of Robert Helbig during his final year of life. He was bed ridden and needed bandages on his legs changed and dressed. I didn't understand what he died from. Clara shared it was very difficult for her as a 13 yr. old to handle his declining health. She was taking him soup for lunch and when she entered his room he was dead.
