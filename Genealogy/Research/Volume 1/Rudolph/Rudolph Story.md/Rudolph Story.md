# Rudolph

The Rudolph line comes from Bempflingen, Germany which is just south of Stuttgart. Marie Rudolph married Charles Daubel.  Marie was the daughter of Jacob Rudolph and Anna Raisch. It appears that not long after the birth of Marie’s younger brother Christian that Anna died.  The family tale is that the father didn’t feel fit to raise the children so they were raised by their maternal grandparents Christian and Christiana Raisch.  Marie and her brother traveled to the US in 1893 when she was 15 and he was 14. They lived in Philadelphia with one of her aunts on her mothers side. Christian was born with some form of physical disability.  In 1896, when he was 17, he commit suicide in a park in Philadelphia because he did not want to be a burden to his sister. 

Another of Marie’s aunts was Elizabeth Scholz who lived out west near the Daubels. Marie took a trip to visit her aunt and met Charles Daubel whom she later married. Marie had 11 children with Charles.

Marie’s father Jacob traveled to the US in 1881 leaving his children with his in-laws.  He married a woman Anna Hofbrauer with whom he had a daughter Carrie Roehm.  Carrie maintained contact with the Daubels and wrote letters to my Grandfather Herman as his Aunt Carrie.
