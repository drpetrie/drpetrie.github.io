# Jacob Rudolph (1853-1933)

Jacob’s wife Mary Raisch died and he sent their two children to live with his in-laws. He immigrated to the US in 1881 where he married Anna Hofbauer. He must have maintained some contact with his daughter Mary because I have a letter from Jacob’s daughter Carrie Roehm to Mary’s son Herman.
