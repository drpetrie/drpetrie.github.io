# Spence

The Spence line comes from Pontefract England where it appears they had lived for a very long time. They immigrated from England in 1852 living for a short time in Defiance County OH before moving out west to California. The full family of Mathew Spence made the trip to the US. In that family was my 2x great grandfather John Spence. John is another one of the colorful characters in my tree.
