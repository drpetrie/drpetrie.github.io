The Bartosh line comes from what was formerly known as Bohemia and is now present day Czech Republic. 

My great grandmother Anna Bartosh was born in Iowa.  There are a lot of Czech immigrants who settled in Iowa.  With a lot of common names it was little tricky trying to figure out the Bartosh line.  Anna’s father Frank had places of birth listed on three different census as Bohemia, At Sea, and New York.  It appears that he was 7 months old on the ship which explains the uncertainty about where he was born.

My research her was helped extremely when I had a DNA match for Judith Engels who is fully Czech in ancestry. We worked to finally figure out the village that the Bartoshes originated from.  The church records are all in Czech so Judith was instrumental in finding record matches.  I was able to expand the matches to build out the tree a little bit.

When I was in Czech in 2003 I drove from Prague to Cesky Krumlov and would have driven very near the town of Neznasov.

The Bartoshes eventually wound up in North Dakota.
