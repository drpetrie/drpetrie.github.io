The Petrie family line immigrated from Germany in 1891. I’m not exactly sure where in Germany they came from. The children were born in Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany so it’s possible they live around the tri-border area. Mathias was listed with an occupation of welder in the birth certificate of his son John in 1857. 

The spelling of the name looks to originally be “Petri”.  My Grandpa Petrie used to tell the story that he added the “E” to make it “Petrie” because “Petri” looked too Polish. It wasn’t just my Grandfather who changed it. All his siblings seem to have modified the spelling in the 1940s.  Maybe it was related to WW II.
