**Milton Petrie**

Milton was my uncle. He was married four times. He had two boys with Joann Nance and a daughter with Joann Harwi who he married when he was in the army. He was an ambulance driver in the DC area. I had a DNA match was someone from California. I traced it down to a woman Milton met when he was stationed in California doing basic training. He had just gotten married but separated. His wife came down and the girl friend never told him she was pregnant.
