# Robert Petrie (1904-2002)

Robert Petrie is my grandfather. 

Robert moved his family from Bemidji to Spokane. He built a camper on top of a truck bed. The rumor is that he was heading for Denver but a snowstorm forced the decision to go to Spokane. They moved around a bit and are not in the 1940 census. They lived in Conrad, MT. They owned a store in Wallace, ID for awhile. The story is that he added the “e” to Petri because it sounded less Polish. 

I interviewed my Dad and Uncle Dale August 11^th^ 2013 and they said the Petrie family left MN in 1937. This would have meant Dale was just a baby as he was born in Dec 1937.  They thought they were in Conrad, MT in 37-38 and then Wallace, ID. They thought they visited MN in 1939 and then were in Spokane by 1940. They had the store in Wallace Apr-Oct 1946 they thought. They lived in Locust Grove Trailer park before 4^th^ Ave.I found address records than had them on 4807 E. 4^th^ Ave in April 1946 and on Pacific in February 1947.  Dad thought they lived on 4^th^ from Dec 41-46. Somewhere between Oct 46 and Feb 47 Aunt Eva and Uncle Fred convinced Bob to move back to Spokane where Fred was a agent for Superior Roofing.

Dad would remember being put to bed with no lights and his mom and dad would go to meetings during the war. He remembers Clyde and Maxine Nance who where friends with the family

Bob was a carpenter. As a young man he worked in a logging camp. He met his wife Gladys at a dance. 

They lived in Conrad MT for a short while on their trip West. At some point they owned and operated a store and n Wallace ID. Bob and Gladys like to bet on horse races. They bought two lots in New Mexico which I took over tax payment for after Bob died. They used to travel to California to see relatives and would bring back a big sack of walnuts.

The Liberty Township History says this of Robert:

Robert (Bob) Petrie was born November 16, 1904 to John and Gertrude (Helbig) Petrie, Sr. in Liberty Township, Beltrami County, Minnesota.  He was one of four sons of John and Gerty Petrie.  His brothers were Mathias, Alfred, and John Jr.  He had one sister, Marie.  Marie, Bob and John are still living in 1997.  John still lives in Liberty Township.  Marie is in Iowa and Bob lives in Washington.

Bob married Gladys Cooper in 1932.  They held their wedding dance in the Deer Lake Community Club.  Bob said it was the largest crowd at the hall to that date.

Bob did logging and trucking.  They had threes sons born during the next five years.

Many people were heading west during that time.  Two of his brothers, Alfred and Mathias, were among them.  These friends and his brothers were encouraging them to go west.  They finally did in 1937.  Bob got an 8x10 (or 12) foot house from Oscar Richmond.  He mounted the house on the back of his truck.  They packed their possessions in the house and made room to sleep in it at night, as they camped along the way.  They tied a stove and a washing machine on the back of the house and away they went with their three small children, the oldest about four and the youngest was a baby.

This must have been quite a trip!  They traveled west, camping at night.  Roads weren't as good as they are now, mostly gravel and bumpy.  (We complain now about our rough roads, but think of what it must have been. )  It was a slow journey.

They came to a river valley in the mountains of Montana, where they ceded to camp for awhile.  They decided it was time to wash clothes, so the stove and the washer were removed from the back of the truck.  It was a gas operated washer.  They heated the water from the river in a boiler on the wood stove.  When the water was hot enough, they proceeded to wash the clothes.  The clothes were hung on limbs, bushes, or spread on the grass to dry.  It was a bright sunny day, so everything dried quickly, and was soon packed away.

They were on their way again.  They stopped at some friends in western Montana, and Bob worked for awhile.  After a time, they decided to go on to Spokane, Washington, where Bob's brothers lived.  In Spokane, Bob found employment and worked at several jobs.  Finally he got into construction.  He became a foreman and did quite well.

They still live in Spokane.  They have made many trips back to Minnesota to visit family and friends over the years.  They have also traveled to many other places in the states.

in 1996, they made a trip to Albuquerque, NM on business.  From there they came to Minnesota.  Bob was 91 years young and Gladys was in her 80's.  Gladys did most of the driving, but Bob would drive fifty miles or so to give her a rest.  From Minnesota, they returned home, after visiting with family and many friends.  They are planning to come again this fall of 1997, sometime in September.  They are a remarkable couple - so lively for their ages, and so interesting to visit with.  May they continue to be in good health for many years.  I'm sure their boys are very proud of them.

We were sad to hear of Bob having a stroke recently.  We talked to John, his brother, who says Bob seems to be doing pretty well, but their trip is off for this year.  May he recover completely and live for a long time yet.  We are all praying for them.

Robert had three sons, Milton, Vern and Dale
