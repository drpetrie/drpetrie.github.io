# Mathias Petri (1846-1925)

The first Petri family that immigrated was that of Mathias Petri who arrived on 4/1/1891 in New York on the ship Westernland which served the Red Star Line from Antwerp, Belgium to New York. The ship manifest shows 7 individuals, with the occupation of laborer, with 4 pieces of luggage from Germany headed to Albany, New York.

When the Petri's landed they would have been processed through the Barge Office processing center which pre-dated Ellis Island.

I found a birth record for a Mathias Petry in Saarland which is a Germany area bordering Luxembourg so the area is correct. The birth date is 12 Feb but Mathias’ grave says 13 Feb. So I’m not positive if this is him. 

The passenger manifest has them bound for Albany. By June 1895 they had made their way to Avon, MN

The Liberty Township History says this of Mathias:

Mathias Petrie and his wife Katherine emigrated from Germany as a young couple.  They settled in Avon, Minnesota, which is a little town near the Twin Cities \[south of St. Cloud\].  Mathias and his son John Petrie (Senior) came to this area and both homesteaded here in the late 1800's.  They walked the trail from Park Rapids to Bemidji.  Mathias and his wife homestead in Section 6 of Liberty Township.

Mathias had four son’s. John is the father of my Grandpa Petrie.  Edward was the second son. We see him in the Minnesota state census in 1895 but then I can find no further records of him at all. Champy was the third son.  He was married three times.  After his brother John died, Gertrude married a neighbor named John Erickson, who I heard that he commit suicide. After John passed Champy and Gertrude got married. The fourth son was Victor who moved to Ontario.

Mathias suffered a stroke in 1921 and was confined to a wheelchair.
