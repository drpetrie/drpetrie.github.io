# John Petrie (1875-1913)

John Petrie was born in Rumelange, Luxembourg on August 24^th^ 1875. It was a long time before I located any Petri documents in Europe. I finally found the birth certificate of John.


He arrived in the US in 1891 with his family.

John was a Logger, Justice of the Peace, and US Postmaster. 

I had no photo of John and had never seen one.  Then in 2022 I had a DNA match with a Melanie Teems from Maryland. I contacted her and discovered that she was the daughter of Marie Petri who was the daughter of John.  She shared with me some photos to include one of John at his marriage to Gertrude.

The marriage of John to Gertrude is an interesting one. The story that great grandma Petri always told was that she was a “mail order bride”.  Gertrude was living in Santa Fe, New Mexico and married John who was living in Minnesota. So it does appear that this was some sort of “mail order” marriage.  Gertrude was 19 and John was 27 when they were married.

John sadly died young at the age of 38 in a logging accident.  My grandpa was only 9 when his father died.

The Liberty Township History says this of John:

Mathias and his son John Petrie (Senior) came to this area and both homesteaded here in the late 1800's.  They walked the trail from Park Rapids to Bemidji.  Mathias and his wife homestead in Section 6 of Liberty Township.  John homesteaded by Long Lake.  John married Gertrude Helbig, who came up here from Santa Fe, New Mexico.

John and Gertrude had five children.  They named them, Mathias, Robert, Fred, John Jr. and Marie.  They farmed and logged to make their living.  When John Jr. was 2 years old his father was killed in a logging accident.  Gertrude remained on the farm and later married Jack Erickson.  Jack owned land that joined Gertrude's so they farmed both places.  The children all went to Long Lake School.  Some years later Jack died and a few years after that Gertrude married Champy Petrie.  Champy was a brother to Gertrude's first husband.  They moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin for a few years and then returned to live in Liberty Township.
