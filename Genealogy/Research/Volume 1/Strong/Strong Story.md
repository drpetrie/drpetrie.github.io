The Strong family line is probably the strongest, pun intended, of all the family names. This line traces back to Elder John Strong who sailed either on the “Mary and John” in 1630 or the “Hopewell” in 1635 to the Massachusetts Colony. Through the Strong line we are cousins or half-cousins to hundreds of famous people including John Adams Jr, John Quincy Adams, Louisa May Alcott, Grover Cleveland, Calvin Coolidge, Emily Dickinson, Rutherford B. Hayes, Anthony Perkins, John D. Rockefeller, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Orson Welles, the Wright brothers and many, many more.

Our recent Strong line comes from Farmersville, NY where they migrated West to Spokane in 1884 when Walter Ezra Strong and his wife Jennie (Newman) Strong came west.  A grand daughter of Walter, Jean Strong, wrote a Strong history which I have included in part below. 

**STRONG FAMILY HISTORY**

Dear Family:

I have tried to put together for you, as much of the history of our family that I can.

Most of my sources were a scrap book left by Grandma Strong, a book of Jack Cook's, letters and documents, and the history of Spokane County on file at the Spokane Library.

Stories, told to me by my Mother and Father I have tried to verify to some extent, by other sources.

**STRONG**

In the spring of 1884 Grandma and Grandpa Strong decided to come out west to a place that they had heard of called Spokane Falls.

At that time the area was covered with a beautiful virgin forest of tall pines. The soft prairie winds rustled and whispered through the trees. This was also the home of the Spokane Indians and many wild animals ran through the forests. Hunting for deer, rabbits and birds was easy for there was an abundancy.

There was a trading post where the city of Spokane now lies. It was called the Spokane Falls Trading Post. Drinking water from the river was brought around in whiskey barrels for the residents. Indians came and asked for discarded fruit which had spoiled and the squaws sat and ate it as though it tasted good.

Chester Arthur was President, the year was 1884, and in the early spring o! that year, grandma and Grandpa came to begin their new life. They had chartered a box car on the Railroad to come out west.

In the rear of the box car they put their stock - a team - 2 cows, some chickens, and a bred sow. Next was the hay, grain, and some farming equipment (plow, harrow, etc.)

In the front of the car they had the kitchen range, a table, benches, 2 beds a chest of drawers (which we still have at the farm) and Grandma's rocker.

The men slept in the back of the car on the hay. Grandma and the children, Grace, Mattie and Dewitt slept in the front. Great Grandma Strong (Percilla) Jenny Strong's brother Carl Newman, and a friend Jack Cook, all traveled out with Grandma and Grandpa.

It was a long and tiring trip. They bought supplies as they could along the way. They arrived in Spokane in late March. The last of the winter snow was leaving. The March winds were cold so they decided to stay close to Spokane Falls until later in the spring before they decided where they wished to look for homestead property.

On April 21, 1884 they moved to Wild Rose Prairie - which according to an old address stamp of Grandfather Strong's was called Wild Rose Valley, Washington. Just when it was changed to Wild Rose Prairie, I was unable to find out. At first they lived in a tent in the heart of the prairie. Carl and Jack stayed in Spokane to find work, because by then the family funds were very low.

The Prairie is composed of approximately 15 square miles north and a few miles west of the city limits of Spokane and about 6 miles south of Deer Park.

Mr. and Mrs. Henry Maxum, who came two years before Grandma and Grandpa in 1882, loved the wild roses that they found and Mrs. Maxum was influential in naming the prairie “Wild Rose Prairie."

In late April the wild flowers (Buttercups, easter lily, wild rose and many more) were in bloom on the hills.

Salmon came up the rivers and into the creeks. The men would throw them out onto the banks with pitchforks. They were taken home in tubs and smoked for winter use. Sometimes they would pile brush into the creek. The salmon would jump onto the brush and were helpless. There were no game laws. Deer were plentiful and people took what was needed, often taking the choice meat and letting the nest go to waste. There were rabbits, pheasants and bear, besides the beautiful deer.

A cayuse (Indian Pony) could be bought from the Indians for one to five dollars or you could trade them a sack of flour for a pony. Wild hay was cut on natural meadows for horses and cows. A cradle or scythe and a wooden hand rake were used.

There was an abundancy of wild food but times were very hard and the pioneers used tops cut from their rubber boots to make shoes for their children. There were long days of back breaking work for both men and women.

In the winter the snow was very deep and there were no roads, just trails blazed through the woods. The first main road was the old Colville Trail. Trees were marked with axes so the trail could be followed. The spotted road got the name from these marks on the trees. Trails were cut to homesteads, schools and post offices.

Now the year is 1885. Grover Cleveland is in office. Mr. Carter and Mr. Brown opened a sawmill. Men who wanted to go to work for them were paid $1.00 a day, room and board. However they had to furnish their own blankets for the bunk house. A day most often was not eight hours, but ten - to sixteen hours. Many men had teams of horses, and worked logging these long hard days. This was not only hard on the men but very hard on the horses also. Logs sold for $2.25 per thousand feet. Mr. Gemmill purchased the mill from Carter and Brown.

Most of the men, both summer and winter walked to Spokane to buy supplies, and carried them home on their backs. So it was very welcome, when Mr. Hazard who had come to the prairie the same year that Grandma and Grandpa, started a store. A year later added a post office. This was known as Hazard, Washington. Mr. Hazard drove to Spokane with team and wagon every Friday for store supplies and mail. The men would gather around the store, exchanging stories and visiting, when they came once every several days - or once a week to pick up the mail.

Small villages, like Deer Park, with two or three houses sprang up. A storekeeper Pete Kelly, had two pet deer which the Hutchin's boys had caught. This is how Deer Park got it's name.

The early settlers of Wild Rose had several Indian scares. The most frightening was in the summer of 1886. Grandma and Grandpa had been here two years by that time. The settlers, consisting of 15 large families, gathered at Fort Tarbert and Fort Griffith which were amply fortified. They lived together at the fort for several nights until soldiers arrived and the soldiers remained for a week. No further trouble was mentioned.

In 1886, the Boorman family came to Wild Rose. They had a small store about one-half mile from where the Wild Rose Church stands. Settlers came for miles to patronize it because it was the only store selling calico. There were only a few pieces to choose from, so many ladies had dresses alike. Supplies were bought wholesale in bulk and weighted out for customers. Coffee was bought in 10 pound lots and sold for 10¢ a lb. Sugar was 6 lbs for 25¢. Some folks bought yard goods by the bolt and all the family had dresses, shirts, etc. alike..

Later, there was a store on the Lash place, but as Deer Park grew, it took the trade, so Mr. Lash grew celery for sale. Mr. Prufer was the pioneer celery raiser, so was called the "Celery King".

In the same year, 1886, two years after Grandma and Grandpa came to the prairie, Uncle Will was born. He was born at Spokane Falls. We believe, but cannot prove, that the reason they returned to Spokane Falls, was because they felt they had lost the first property they were trying to homestead.

Grandpa had filed to homestead the property in the heart of the prairie next to Hazards, where they were living in a tent. Another man had later settled on part of this property and had also filed to homestead. It soon became clear that it would have to be settled in court who had the homestead rights, Grandpa's lawyer took the case to Seattle, the closest court in the area for a hearing. When the lawyer returned to Spokane, he did not get off the train but only signaled to Grandpa, from the train, as it slowed going through Spokane Falls. He signaled that Grandpa had won the case, but Grandpa misunderstood him, and thought he had lost. We think it was at this time they stayed in Spokane Falls for a short time.

A meal at this time in Spokane Falls, at a restaurant would cast 25¢. Overalls were 75¢. Work shoes $1.50. Wood was 50¢ a cord. However, with a man and team making only $2.50 a day, I am sure Grandma watched the budget carefully.

Just exactly when they returned to the prairie we do not know for sure, but. they homesteaded the property in 1889 where they spent the rest of their lives. The deed is dated 1889 so they must have returned to the prairie shortly after Uncle Will was born since it took some time to get a homestead deed through the courts.

Their home and farm was known for years as the Edgewood Fruit farm. They raised all kinds of fruit. Cherries, plums, peaches, apples, apricots and also sold butter and milk.

It wasn't long until J.D. Walters came and homesteaded the property next to Grandma and Grandpa and he raised strawberries. They were for the rest of their lives very close friends.

Snow came early and stayed until late in the spring. Four feet of snow was average but some winters there was six feet. Timber was cut with high stumps in the winter. If you had to travel at night with the team of horses and the wagon on buggy, often the wife would walk ahead carrying the lantern so the wagon would not get hung up on the high stumps. Cattle ate the moss from these fallen trees in the winter for food.

Stump burners were made and used to clear land. Stumps were grubbed out by hand. Logs were set afire and covered with dirt. This developed into charcoal which was taken to Spokane and sold.

Later schools were built and children walked many miles to these schools. Usually going only a couple days a week. They would carry their slates and chalk, because all pencils and paper were a luxury. When the first school was built it was late in the fall before it was finished. When school started there were no floors. Pine boards served as desks and seats. Pitch oozed from rough boards and got on the books and clothing. Mischievous boys put pitch in the girls braided hair. The teachers salary for the month was $20.00. The teacher usually lived with one of the families in the area and paid board and room, or she would live a short time with each family in the area. Each family subscribed a certain amount each year toward the teacher's salary. There were no taxes. The children chewed Tamarack gum, gun made from the pitch from the Tamarack trees. I remember chewing this gum, it wasn't very tasty.

In 1891 Aunt Ethel was horn, 1896 Dady (guy Alfred) was born. About two years later little Carl was born, however he died when he was very young. At that time coffins were homemade. The men built the box and the women would line them.

There were no doctors in the area at first and Grandma Strong was usually the one called to deliver the babies. She had instruments and was considered a midwife. The first doctor came several years later and settled in Chattaroy. Someone would have to ride on horse back to bring him back to the ailing person.

There also were no jails - so until 1889 when the railroad came to Deer Park there was no place to lock someone up. After that time the Police Judge in Deer Park would lock them in a box car.

Preserving food took a lot of effort. When they would kill game and beef to preserve they would smoke it or put it down in a salty brine. Fruits were dried. Potatoes, cabbage, carrots and most of the root vegetables were buried in root cellars or pits lined with straw.

**THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE APPEARED IN THE SPOKANE PAPERS:**

“WILD ROSE PRATRIE, Wash., Oct, 24, 1921”

"Walter E. Strong for 37 years a resident of Wild Rose, and one of the real pioneer settlers of that district, passed away Saturday evening at 6 o'clock, after three weeks illness of internal carcinoma.

“Mr. Strong was born February 6, 1854 at Farmersville, N.Y. and was 67 years of age at the time of his death. Surviving him, besides Mrs. Strong to whom he was married July 3, 1875, are three sons F.D. Strong of Camp 17, W.H. Strong of Wild Rose and Guy who lives at home; three daughters, Mrs. R.M. Cline of Wild Rose, Mrs. Arthur Cline of Williams valley and Mrs. J.W. Yandell of Deer Park; also 21 grandchildren residing in this immediate vicinity."

"Deceased was always an active worker in the Modern Woodmen of America, and B.A.Y. Lodges. Ever ready and willing to do his part in church and social affairs in his neighborhood, he was withal, a loving husband and kind father. He came to the state in 1884, settling on Wild Rose Prairie on April 21 of that year."

"Funeral services were held at the M.E. church on Wild Rose, Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock, Rev. Dow Delong having charge. Interment was made in Wild Rose Cemetery. The M.W.A, had charge of the services at the grave, over forty cars bearing relatives and friends to his last resting place."

Edgewood school house, was where I went to school the first eight years. I walked from Grandma's farm about a mile to the school. In the winter time we would wade through the snow up to our knees. The school was a one room school house with a pot belly stone. Out by the door was a bucket of water, and a tin cup. We all drank from the same tin cup. There was a pump to the well on the front porch and when the bucket was empty the teacher would ask one of the older boys to go and fill it. All eight grades were in the one room. Usually one, or maybe two children in each grade.
