The Cooper line goes way back into US history. I have definitively traced it back to Samuel Cooper b. 1774 in Rhode Island. Very likely the Coopers were part of the great migration of the early 1600s with the line connecting to Thomas Cooper b. 1604 who immigrated to America in 1638. 

The family of Samuel Cooper is clustered in the Ceres, PA-NY area which is on the border with Pennsylvania
