**Petrie** - The Petrie line can be traced bed to the Luxembourg/Germany area. Here are the birth places that have been identified

1846 - Germany - Mathias

1848 - Germany - Katherine Riel

1875 - Luxembourg  - John

1879 - Prussia - Edward (All claimed Prussia this year; only census I have for Edward)

1888 - Germany - Champy - (in 1917 started reporting as Belgium)

1890 - Germany - Victor  (in 1920 started reporting as Belgium)

1891 - Arrival

Other than John they all point to Germany. I think that Champy and Victor started to claim Belgium as a means to differentiate themselves from Germany. Much in the same way that my Grandpa Robert added the “e” to Petri to make it sound “less Polish.” Either that or because they sailed from Antwerp in 1891 they claimed Belgium.

The family left Antwerp Belgium on the Westernland, run by Red Star Line, and arrived in New York on 01Apr 1891 in The Barge Office, New York City - Manhattan.
