**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

Mathias Petri was born around **1850** in the **Saarland region** of Germany—a contested borderland near **France and Luxembourg**, historically shaped by coal mining, Catholic traditions, and shifting national borders. By the 1870s and 1880s, economic hardship and political pressures (including mandatory military service and German unification under Prussia) spurred many families to migrate westward.

Mathias and his wife **Katherine Riel** appear to have lived in **Luxembourg** and **Belgium** during the births of their children in the 1870s and 1880s. Their multilingual, multinational journey reflects the broader experience of working-class laborers in the German-speaking parts of Europe.

On **April 1, 1891**, the Petri family boarded the **SS Westernland**, a Red Star Line ship, in **Antwerp, Belgium**, and sailed to **New York**, arriving with **seven family members**, four pieces of luggage, and a stated destination of **Albany, New York**. They were processed through the **Barge Office** in Manhattan, as this was just before **Ellis Island** opened.

By the late 1890s or early 1900s, Mathias and his family relocated to **Minnesota**, where they homesteaded land in **Liberty Township** near **Bemidji**. His son **John Petri** became a logger, postmaster, and Justice of the Peace, continuing the family’s pioneer legacy.

**Legacy and Impact:**

Mathias Petri laid the foundation for the **Petri/Petrie family line in America**. His migration from industrial Germany to the American frontier reflects a classic immigrant arc: driven by economic and social pressures, persevering through transatlantic upheaval, and planting roots in rural America.

His descendants spread from **Minnesota to Washington**, adopting new ways of life while honoring their immigrant beginnings. The spelling of the family name eventually evolved from **Petri to Petrie**, reflecting the Americanization process common to many immigrant families.

**Petrie, Mathias (1846-1925)**

Mathias was the first Petrie to come from to the US. He appears to have been from the Luxembourg and Germany area. I found a birth record for a Mathias Petry in Saarland. The birth date is 12 Feb but his grave say 13 Feb. So I’m not positive if this is him. 

He settled in Bemidji MN where he lived out the rest of his life.
