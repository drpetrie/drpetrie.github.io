**Historical Notes:**

* Robert Petrie was born in **Liberty Township**, a small frontier community in northern Minnesota settled by logging families, immigrants, and homesteaders like his parents. 
* His early childhood was marked by tragedy: his father **John Petri** died in a **logging accident** when Robert was still young, leaving his mother **Gertrude** to raise five children alone.
* In the **early 1930s**, Robert met and married **Gladys Cooper** from North Dakota with Czech and Pennsylvania ancestry. 
* They married in **1932**, and the young couple worked together in the **logging camps of Minnesota**, with Gladys serving as **camp cook**. Robert, like many men of his generation, learned the hard skills of timber work and construction by necessity.
* In **1937**, seeking new opportunities and perhaps more stable living conditions for their growing family, Robert and Gladys moved west. Their journey included stops in **Conrad, Montana**, and **Wallace, Idaho**, before they ultimately settled in **Spokane, Washington**. There, Robert established himself as a **carpenter** and later became a **store owner**, providing for his family in the rapidly expanding urban environment of the Pacific Northwest.
* Family stories reveal that Robert was practical, hardworking, and self-reliant. He adapted from forest life to city life, but never lost the grit forged in Minnesota’s north woods.
* **Name Change:** At some point during his adult life, Robert adopted the spelling **“Petrie”**, adding an “e” to the original family name “Petri.” The story is that he added the “e” to Petri because it sounded less Polish.  This was likely to ease pronunciation, to assimilate culturally, or possibly to differentiate from extended family. The new spelling became standard for his descendants.
* Though his early years were shaped by hardship and migration, Robert helped lay the groundwork for future stability and opportunity. His life journey mirrors the broader American story of transition—from timber, toil, and trains to neighborhoods, careers, and grandchildren.
* Robert moved his family from Bemidji to Spokane. He built a camper on top of a truck bed. The rumor is that he was heading for Denver but a snowstorm forced the decision to go to Spokane. They moved around a bit and are not in the 1940 census. They lived in Conrad, MT. They owned a store in Wallace, ID for awhile. 
* Bob was a carpenter. As a young man he worked in a logging camp. He met his wife Gladys at a dance.
