He butchered his own cows.  We would hang them in the barn and skin them.  I can still remember accidentally cutting a stomach once and the smell that emanated.  He hunted deer.  He shot a bear once.  We had the bear rug for years before moths got it.  
* We bought a boat and used to fish for trout and walleye.  We fished at many lakes.  Liberty, Davis, Lake Roosevelt, Sacheen.  We used to go to Sullivan Lake and pan for gold in LeClair Creek.  We picked many a gallon of huckleberries near Sullivan Lake.

We had an intercom hooked up between the back and the truck cab.  We went to Kalaloch Beach, Agate beach, Hurricane ridge.  
* We took a vacation to California and the Redwood forest.  We stopped at Crater Lake.  We went to the lava fields.
