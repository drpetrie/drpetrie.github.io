**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

Charles Cooper was born in **Shinglehouse, Pennsylvania**, in 1879, part of a family with deep roots in early American settlement. His father, **Oscar Cooper**, migrated west to the **Dakotas** in the 1880s, and Charles followed suit as a young adult.

He first married **Bertha Clausen** in **Hecla, South Dakota**, in 1900. Their union produced a son, **Edwin Cooper**, but the marriage ended in divorce. Later, Charles married **Anna Bartosh**, the daughter of Czech immigrants **Frank Bartosh** and **Mary Reha**, on **November 25, 1913**. They went on to raise five children together.

The Cooper family moved frequently, first within the Dakotas and then to **Cayuga, North Dakota**, around 1910, eventually relocating to **Bemidji, Minnesota**, by the late 1920s. This westward movement mirrored the broader migration of families seeking better land, opportunity, and community stability in the Upper Midwest during the early 20th century.

**Legacy:**

Charles Cooper’s life was shaped by transition—from the rural hills of Pennsylvania to the windswept plains of the Dakotas, and finally to the pine forests and lakes of northern Minnesota. His blended family, including the eventual reunion of his daughter **Gladys** with her half-brother **Edwin**, speaks to the complexity and resilience of pioneer families.

Charles died in **Bemidji, Minnesota**, in 1948, having witnessed massive change—from horse-powered farming to the postwar modern era. He is buried in **Greenwood Cemetery**, leaving a legacy through children who carried the Cooper name forward across Minnesota and the Pacific Northwest.
