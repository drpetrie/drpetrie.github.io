**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

Frank Bartosh was born in **1864** in **Neznašov**, a village in southern **Bohemia**, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He immigrated with his family as an infant to the **United States**, settling in **Iowa**—a state with one of the largest Czech populations in America at the time.

Frank came of age in a Czech farming community that preserved its language, Catholic traditions, and rural ways of life. In **1887**, he married **Mary Reha**, likely also of Czech descent. Together, they built a life farming in Iowa, raising **eight children** in the close-knit ethnic community.

By **1911**, the Bartosh family had moved west to **North Dakota**, part of a broader second wave of land-seeking families moving into the **Dakota frontier**. Many Czech families were drawn by the promise of **cheap homestead land** and opportunities to establish larger farms.

Frank settled in or near **Cayuga**, Sargent County, before ultimately dying in **Lisbon, North Dakota**, in **1919**, likely from illness or hardship following the brutal winters and challenges of farming the plains.

**Legacy and Cultural Roots:**

Frank Bartosh was part of a generation of Czech immigrants who laid the groundwork for ethnic community life in the American Midwest. Like many Bohemian settlers, he brought with him values of **hard work, faith, family loyalty**, and **self-sufficiency**.

His children and grandchildren, including **Anna Bartosh** (who married Charles Cooper), continued that legacy by moving into Minnesota and Washington, helping knit the Bartosh family into a broader pioneer narrative that spans the Midwest and Pacific Northwest.

**Bartosh, Frank Louis (1864-1919)**
