**Historical Context:**

Anna was part of a generation of Czech-American women born just after their parents’ immigration from Bohemia. Growing up in Iowa and the Dakotas, Anna would have been shaped by rural farming life and a strong immigrant community that valued hard work, self-reliance, and Catholic faith. Like many daughters of Czech settlers, she likely participated in home life, farming duties, and community events. Her marriage to Charles Cooper blended two pioneering families, and their eventual move to Minnesota followed the broader migration pattern of families seeking opportunity in new agricultural frontiers.

Anna was born in Iowa in 1888. She married Jess Perry when she was 21 and had one son William. She divorced Jess and married Charles Cooper with whom she had children.  William was adopted by Charles and was known as Bill Cooper.

When I was just an infant my mom tells me that Great Grandma Cooper was there when a man who was a neighbor said. “He’s so young his eyes haven’t opened yet.”  Anna replied, “He’s sleeping silly.”
