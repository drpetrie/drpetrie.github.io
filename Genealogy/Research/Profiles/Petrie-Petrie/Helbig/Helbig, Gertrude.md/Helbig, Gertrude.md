**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

Gertrude Helbig was born in the **1880s** in **Santa Fe**, which at the time was still a U.S. territory. Her father, **Robert Helbig**, had immigrated from **Dresden, Germany**, in 1881, working as a baker and later as an **industrial teacher at the Albuquerque Indian School**, where his wife, **Pauline**, served as cook.

Tragedy struck early in Gertrude’s life. Her two sisters died either during the family’s migration or shortly after arriving in the U.S. After her mother’s death, Gertrude was raised under the care of her father’s second wife, **Emma Braun (Rights)**—whom Gertrude later described as unkind to the children.

In adulthood, Gertrude became a **mail-order bride**, marrying **John Petri**, a Luxembourg-born logger and postmaster in **Liberty Township, Minnesota**. Together they had five children and helped build a homestead life in rural Minnesota. After John’s **accidental death in a logging accident**, Gertrude was left a widow with young children.

She later remarried **John Erickson**, but the marriage ended in divorce. Then, in a remarkable family twist, she married her former brother-in-law, **Champy Petri**, in **1946**. Two days after that marriage, her ex-husband **John Erickson died by suicide**, adding to the complexity of her personal story.
