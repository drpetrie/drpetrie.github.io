**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

Robert Helbig was born in **1852** in **Dresden**, then part of the **Kingdom of Saxony**, during a time of social and political upheaval in the German states. In **1881**, he immigrated to the United States, likely seeking better opportunities and escape from rising militarization and economic instability in the German Empire.

Upon arrival, Robert was listed as a **baker** and settled in **New Mexico**, working at the **Albuquerque Indian School**, a federally run boarding school for Native American children. He taught industrial skills—likely related to cooking, baking, or vocational training—while his wife **Pauline** served as the school’s **cook**.

Tragically, their two daughters, both born in Germany, died during or shortly after their immigration. After **Pauline’s death**, Robert remarried **Emma Braun** (a.k.a. Emma Rights), though their relationship was strained, particularly concerning her treatment of his surviving children.

Later in life, Robert moved to **northern Minnesota**, where his daughter **Gertrude** had married **John Petri**. He lived in **Liberty Township**, working as a **camp cook** and helping to build vital infrastructure such as **roads and bridges**—no small feat in the rugged northern landscape.

He died at the home of his daughter **Maria Klasen** in **1937**, and was buried in **Bemidji**, where many members of the extended Petri and Helbig families resided.

**Legacy:**

Robert Helbig lived a life marked by reinvention, adaptation, and quiet service. From the bustling royal city of **Dresden** to the remote logging camps of **northern Minnesota**, he contributed to his community in tangible, physical ways—feeding workers, educating Native youth, and helping to build up the infrastructure of rural America.

Though his personal life was marred by hardship and family loss, Robert’s resilience and hard work left a lasting impression on his descendants, including **Gertrude Helbig**, whose legacy continues through the Petri/Petrie family line.

**Helbig, Robert (1852-1937)**

Robert was born in Germany. I haven't found his immigration records. He worked at an Indian school in Albuquerque. Rumor is his wife (second?) was mean. He seems to have remarried in Santa Fe. He went to Minnesota after his daughter Gertrude got married to John Petri. She was a mail order bride. Robert suffered in his old age. There are a lot of interesting stories about Robert. He was a baker at the Albuquerque Indian School. He was hurt by a bull. He worked as a cook in a logging camp in Minnesota and was stabbed in the back by a man with a knife.
