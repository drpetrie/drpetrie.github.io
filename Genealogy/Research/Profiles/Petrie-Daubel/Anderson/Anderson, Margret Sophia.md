**Historical Context:**

Margaret Anderson was part of the wave of **Swedish immigration** that surged between the 1860s and early 1900s, when more than a million Swedes left their homeland due to poor economic conditions, crop failures, and religious constraints. Stockholm, as the capital, was not only a city of opportunity but also a launching point for many who left for America seeking new lives.

Women like Margaret often arrived as young adults and quickly found work or spouses in immigrant communities. It’s likely she met **John Spence** in the American West, where Scandinavian women were sought after as wives and homemakers in newly settled frontier regions. Settling in **northeastern Washington**, Margaret took part in the rugged and resourceful lifestyle typical of early settlers—farming, raising children, and building homesteads in dense forest and rolling hills.

The Anderson surname is common in Sweden and often derived from the patronymic system (i.e., daughter of Anders). Swedish communities in the Pacific Northwest maintained strong cultural ties through Lutheran churches, food traditions, and social clubs.
