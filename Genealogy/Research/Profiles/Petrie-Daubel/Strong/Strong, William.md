**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

William E. Strong was born in **Buffalo, New York**, in **1856**, during a time of rapid expansion in upstate New York fueled by the Erie Canal, railroads, and trade. He received a basic education in the public schools and learned the **carpentry trade**, which would serve him well on the frontier.

In **1884**, William joined a large-scale migration westward with his parents and extended family. The Strongs took the **train west**, bringing with them household goods, tools, and livestock to start new lives on the open lands of **Wild Rose Prairie**, just north of Spokane in **Washington Territory** (five years before Washington achieved statehood).

William helped clear land, build homes, and establish the community infrastructure in the area. As a **carpenter**, he played a central role in turning the forested prairie into a habitable landscape—constructing homes, barns, and perhaps early civic buildings. He married **Ida Hamilton** in Washington and continued to live in the Spokane region for the rest of his life.

**Legacy and Character:**

William was part of the **second generation of the Strong family** to carry the pioneering spirit westward. His life story reflects both a continuation of his father’s homesteading legacy and a practical contribution to the physical building of communities. He lived through the transformation of Spokane from frontier outpost to modern city and witnessed over 80 years of American change—from the Civil War era through the Second World War.

As part of the extended **Strong–Crandall family**, William also represents the enduring legacy of **Elder John Strong**, the family’s original Puritan ancestor who settled in Massachusetts in the 1600s.

**Strong, William Henry (1887-1967)**
