Historical Notes:

* Born in 1914, Thressa Strong grew up on Wild Rose Prairie, an agricultural region northwest of Spokane. 
* She was the daughter of Walter Ezra Strong, part of a prominent pioneer family that had migrated from New York to the Spokane region in 1884. 
* Her mother, Jennie Newman, also came from a family that homesteaded in the Inland Northwest.
* Growing up in the early 20th century, Thressa experienced the challenges of rural life—chores, schoolhouse education, and the lean years of the Great Depression. She would have attended local prairie schools and helped care for siblings and farm responsibilities from a young age.
* In 1937, Thressa married Herman Carl Daubel, a logger and farmer from the nearby Elk–Milan area. Together, they raised six children, supporting their family through farming, logging, and later industrial work. Their life spanned a period of great technological and social transformation in rural Washington—from horse-drawn wagons and hand tools to automobiles and post-war industry.
* Thressa was remembered as a strong, resourceful, and devoted mother, raising her children with the same pioneer values passed down from her parents: faith, hard work, resilience, and community care. She lived into her 80s and remained close to family, continuing the Strong–Daubel lineage in northeastern Washington.
* She represents the third generation of women in her family to live out their lives on the land first settled by their immigrant ancestors—bridging the homesteading era with the modern age while keeping family traditions alive.
* Theresa was born and raised in Washington. 
* She met Herman who was working for her father. He was a bit older than her.
