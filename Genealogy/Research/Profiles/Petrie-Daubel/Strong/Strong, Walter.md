**Historical Context:**

Walter Strong was born during the British colonial period, just six years before American independence. He was part of the early post-Revolution generation that expanded westward from New England into New York’s wilderness as part of America’s first great internal migration.

By the early 1800s, Walter had moved to **Cattaraugus County**, part of western New York state that had only recently been opened to white settlement following treaties with the Seneca Nation. This region was a frontier in his day, where dense forests were cleared for subsistence farming and tight-knit communities formed around churches and schools.

As the father of **Ezra Brewster Strong Sr.**, Walter is part of a documented line descending from **Elder John Strong**, one of the prominent Puritan settlers of New England in the 1600s. The Strong family is deeply entwined with colonial and early American history, and many of its descendants would later migrate further west through New York, the Midwest, and on to Washington.

**Strong, Walter Ezra (1855-1921)**

Walter was born in 1855 in Farmersville NY. He married Jennie Newman and they migrated west in 1884 and settle on Wild Rose Prairie
