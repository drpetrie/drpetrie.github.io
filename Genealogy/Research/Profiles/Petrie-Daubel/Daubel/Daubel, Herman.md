Historical Notes:

* Born and raised in rural northeastern Washington, Herman Carl Daubel was a product of the pioneering Daubel family who helped settle the Elk region after emigrating from Germany in the 1880s. 
* He attended local country schools, beginning with Muhle School and then Deer Creek School, walking several miles daily. 
* At one point, he even served as an early “school bus driver,” earning $15 a month to drive a horse team and pick up the younger children.
* Herman’s early work life began in the logging industry. He first worked for the Spokane Lumber Company in Milan, then for Edwards and Bradford in Elk, and continued as a logger into the early 1930s. When the logging work dried up during the Depression, Herman spent a few years on the coast working on a farm.
* In 1937, Herman returned home and married Thressa Strong, daughter of a prominent pioneering family from Wild Rose Prairie. Together they raised a large family and continued the tradition of rural life. 
* Herman farmed, cut wood, and later joined the workforce at Kaiser Aluminum, helping to support his family through WWII and the postwar era.
* Herman Daubel was remembered as a quiet man, humble and hardworking. He had a deep knowledge of the land and the rhythm of life in northeastern Washington. 
* In a 1971 “Senior Spotlight” interview, Herman recalled driving to Milan for groceries and even taking the train to Spokane for items that couldn’t be found locally.
* He spoke of school days when recess would be canceled due to cougars prowling too close to the schoolhouse—an indication of how wild and untamed the region still was during his youth. These stories paint a picture of a man who bridged two eras: the final decades of the frontier and the rise of modern industry in rural America.
* Herman was born and raised in Washington. 
* He worked for his uncle Philip in Thurston for awhile. He moved back after Philip died. 
* He had 7 brothers and sisters. 
* He died of a heart attack in 1977.  
* He was a quiet man. 
* He worked as a farmer, logger and then at Kaiser Aluminum.
