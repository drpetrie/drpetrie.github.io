**Historical Context:**

Ludwig Daubel was born in 1839 in **Bonfeld**, a rural village in the Neckar district of the Kingdom of Württemberg—then a German state within the Holy Roman Empire and later the German Confederation. He worked as a **blacksmith**, a highly respected and vital trade in both rural Germany and on the American frontier.

In **1885**, Ludwig and his wife **Magdalene Streib** applied for emigration and received formal permission from the Württemberg government. Their application stated that they held **3,000 marks**, equivalent to about $20,000 today—an unusually large sum, indicating they were relatively prosperous.

The family emigrated due to the **pressures of militarization** in Germany and in search of better opportunities for their sons. They traveled via **Antwerp to New York**, eventually settling in **Hanover, Kansas**, home to a German-speaking immigrant community.

By the early 1890s, Ludwig’s sons had moved west and homesteaded land near **Elk, Washington**, lured by the promise of fertile land and railroad expansion. Ludwig and Magdalene followed them, becoming early settlers in **northeastern Washington**. Ludwig likely continued his trade in the growing pioneer town, helping with both farming equipment and local blacksmithing needs.

**Legacy:**

Ludwig Daubel’s descendants played a significant role in the development of the **Elk and Milan, WA** area. His son **Charles** established a farm and a small sawmill, and his grandson **Herman Daubel** became a logger, farmer, and later worked at Kaiser Aluminum. The Daubels were among the early European-American families to root themselves in the Inland Northwest’s transition from wilderness to settled farmland.

**Daubel, Ludwig (1839-1924)**

Ludwig Daubel was the first Daubel to come to America. They came from Bonfeld, Germany to America in 1881. He came probably to avoid the conscription of his boys. They first settled in Washington County Kansas where there was a German settlement and lived there for 10 years from 1885-1895. He later homesteaded to Spokane County.  Ludwig is buried in the Milan Cemetery.

His son Philip settled in Thurston County
