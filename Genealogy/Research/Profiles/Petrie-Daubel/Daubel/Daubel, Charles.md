**Historical Context:**

Charles was around 8 years old when he emigrated with his family from **Bonfeld, Germany**, to the United States in **1885**. The Daubels initially settled in **Hanover, Kansas**, part of a large German-speaking immigrant community. Like many immigrant families, they moved westward in search of better land and opportunity—eventually homesteading near **Elk, Washington**, a small community north of Spokane.

Charles came of age in the rugged frontier environment of the Inland Northwest. As a young man, he worked the land, operated a blacksmith shop, and became known for his skill with machinery. He married **Marie Rudolph**, herself a German immigrant who had come to Washington to visit her aunt. They built a large family and were known for their hard work and deep roots in the Elk community.

According to family accounts, Charles could be a stern man. He expected hard labor from his children, sometimes to the point of harshness. One story recalls how, during exhausting summer harvests, if one of his sons fainted from heat, Charles would simply drag him into the shade and wait until he regained consciousness—then it was back to work.

**Homestead Life and Legacy:**

Charles and Marie’s farm was not only productive but highly self-sufficient. They raised fruits (apples, grapes), vegetables, grains, and livestock. They **ground their own grain**, made **cornmeal**, and operated a **sawmill** for building materials. In winter, they harvested blocks of ice from the **Elk mill pond**, stored them in sawdust for year-round use, and even shared the ice with neighbors.

Charles also took his **threshing machine** around to help neighboring farms, providing an essential service in the pre-mechanized era. His skills in both agriculture and mechanical trades helped establish the Daubel family’s respected position in the Elk community.
