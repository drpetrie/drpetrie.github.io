**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

John Spence was born in **Pontefract**, a historic market town in **West Yorkshire**, England, known for its medieval castle ruins and coal mining industry in the 19th century. Economic shifts and industrial labor demands in northern England prompted many to emigrate during this era.

John joined the wave of **British immigrants** seeking opportunity in the American West during the late 19th century. He likely arrived in the **1880s or early 1890s**, settling in the **Washington Territory** just before or after it achieved statehood in 1889.

He married **Margaret Anderson**, a Swedish immigrant from **Stockholm**, as part of a common pattern in pioneer communities—immigrants from different parts of Europe joining together in marriage on the frontier. The couple settled in **Stevens County**, Washington, where they raised their family.

John worked as a **teamster**, a profession essential to early Western communities. Teamsters transported goods, building materials, logs, and agricultural products using teams of horses or oxen. This role was physically demanding and vital to the infrastructure and economy of newly settled areas.

**Life on the Frontier:**

John and Margaret lived in **Clayton**, just north of Spokane. This was a region filled with deep forests, developing railroad lines, and small homesteads. Life in northeastern Washington at the turn of the century required resilience, self-sufficiency, and close-knit community ties.

John died in 1939 and was buried in **Fairview Cemetery**, a modest rural burial ground that holds many early settlers of the region.

**Legacy:**

John Spence represents a classic story of transatlantic migration: from the coalfields and castles of Yorkshire to the deep woods of Washington. Through labor and perseverance, he helped lay the groundwork for future generations, including children like **Josephine Spence**, who would carry the family line forward into the 20th century.

**Spence, John (1835-1916)**

John was born in Pontefract England in 1835. He seems to have traveled far and wide in the West. Ohio, Indiana, Nevada, North Dakota, California, Oregon, and Washington. He was a teamster and seems to have helped people move west and was gone for months at a time. My mother Charlotte captured this note about John.

John Spence would go back East and bring people West and be gone for long periods. Once while he was gone his family was very hungry - the Indians brought them food and said they couldn’t let the family of John Spence go hungry.

This indicates that John had a good relationship with the Indians.
