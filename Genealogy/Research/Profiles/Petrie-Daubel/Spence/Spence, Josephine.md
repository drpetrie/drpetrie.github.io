**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

Born in **1891**, Josephine Spence was a second-generation American born to European immigrant parents. Her father, John W. Spence, was an English-born teamster and homesteader, and her mother, Margaret Anderson, was a Swedish immigrant. Josephine was raised in **Clayton**, a frontier town north of Spokane that was developing through railroads, timber, and farming industries.

As the eldest or one of the older children in a pioneer household, Josephine would have helped with domestic responsibilities, farm chores, and perhaps childcare for younger siblings. This was a time before electricity, running water, or modern appliances—life in Clayton during her youth would have been rustic and physically demanding.

Though she lived through a time of great change—two world wars, the Great Depression, and the arrival of modern technology—Josephine appears to have remained rooted in the same small community all her life. She never married and was buried near her family in **Fairview Cemetery**, a quiet resting place for many early settlers of the area.

**Legacy:**

Josephine represents the quiet strength and endurance of frontier women who helped settle and sustain rural communities in the Pacific Northwest. Though she left no known descendants, her life spanned nearly a century and bridged the pioneer era with the modern age. Her presence in the family reflects the deep immigrant roots and settled traditions of the **Spence–Anderson line** in northeastern Washington.
