**Historical Context and Life Summary:**

Marie Rudolph was born in **Bempflingen**, a Swabian village in southern Germany known for its farming traditions and tight-knit Lutheran community. Like many German families of the era, the Rudolphs sought better opportunities abroad, immigrating to the United States in the **1890s** and settling first in **Philadelphia**, a common entry point for Württemberg families.

As a young woman, Marie traveled west to **Spokane County, Washington**, reportedly to **visit her aunt**. There, she met and married **Charles Daubel**, himself a German-born immigrant and son of Ludwig Daubel, who had moved from Kansas to homestead in **Elk, WA**. Marie and Charles built their life together in this rural, forested region north of Spokane.

Their family was large and self-reliant. Marie bore **eleven children**, all delivered at home, often assisted by a neighbor and local midwife, **Mrs. Staley**. Life on the Daubel farm required hard work, resilience, and ingenuity. Marie helped grow and preserve food, raise livestock, care for children, and support community needs. The Daubels ground their own grain, cut ice from the Elk mill pond, and produced nearly everything they needed on their homestead.

**Legacy and Character:**

Marie was remembered as a **strong, capable matriarch** who guided her family through the Great Depression, two World Wars, and the sweeping changes of the early 20th century. Her deep cultural roots—both German and American—instilled in her children a legacy of thrift, work ethic, and close family ties.

She is buried in **Greenwood Cemetery** near Elk, not far from where she spent most of her life—a fitting resting place for a woman who helped transform the Washington frontier into a settled, thriving home for generations to come.

**Rudolph, Mary (Daubel) (1878-1939)**

Mary was born to Jacob Rudolph and Marie Raisch. She had a brother Christian. Her mother appears to have died when she was very young and they went to live with their grandparents. Mary and Christian immigrated to the US in 1893 and lived with relatives in Philadelphia. Christian committed suicide in 1896.  Mary went west to visit her aunt Elizabeth “Raisch” Scholz where she met Charles Daubel. They were married in 1902 and had eleven children.

From a note that Rosie Daubel wrote:

This is all I know of mother when she was 3 yrs old her mother died she also had a brother which I think was older than she was and her father remarried and his second wife didn’t want his children so they were taken by her grand parents I suppose on her mother side. When she was 15 they figured she was old enough to go on her own so she and her brother were put on the boat and sent to Philadelphia to her aunts One was a Mrs Engelman the other Mrs Pfoff. she worked at housework and had to learn to speak english also write in english and her brother had some incurable sickness and couldn’t work and she had to support him as well. He finally died as mother said but Mrs Scholz told me he committed suicide as he never could get well and was a burden. She came out to Washington to visit her aunt + Uncle the Scholz’s and married so never went back to Philadelphia. This is about all I can remember she had spoke of.
