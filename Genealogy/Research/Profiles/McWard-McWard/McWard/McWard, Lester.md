**McWard, Lester Price (1900-1973)**

Lester was the black sheep of the family. He and his boys were always in and out of trouble. Lester had severe drinking problem. He and Grandpa Elmer were Brothers, nothing in common. His Dad was My Great Grandpa RJ who was very successful in the Implement Company.  I never met Lester.  - Robert McWard 4/21/2019
