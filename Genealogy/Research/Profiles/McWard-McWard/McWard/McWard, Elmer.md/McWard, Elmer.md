Bob, In the 1950 census it shows Elmer (Sheriff) and Helen in the same residence (301 W Franklin St) as two inmates.  Did Elmer live at the Sheriff’s office?

Yes they did. I spent a lot of time there with them. The Sheriff’s Office was in the Court House on the town square. He was the Sheriff for Christian County. Once when I was staying with them Grandma told me to go upstairs and tell the jail keeper that the food she had prepared would be coming up on the dumb waiter. She said to me tell him the good for the jail birds would be coming up. So I went upstairs and told George the only Deputy upstairs that grandma would be sending the food up in a few minutes to the jail birds!! The jail one the top floor only held 4 inmates as I remember. They had one jail break. The prisoners over came the jailer, hit him on the head. I was staying there and remember deputies came quickly to the jail. They took Grandma and myself out to a squad car and up to the courthouse office. The prisoners could not get out cause the door had to be unlocked from the inside. George had a bump on his head. In the 60’s the Sheriffs home and jail was torn down.
