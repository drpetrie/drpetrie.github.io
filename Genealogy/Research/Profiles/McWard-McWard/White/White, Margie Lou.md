**White, Margie Lou**

Robert McWard

Do you know how Margie Lou’s parents died?

You know I do not know. Grandma White raised her as her own, so something happened. She did get married and her first husband died. She had two kids, daughter and son. She remarried to a wealthy farmer, who was a long time bachelor with no kids. He treated her good. Ellen will probably  know more details. She had mental problems and was hospitalized for it many times. I remember she underwent shock treatments which is how they treated mental patients at that time. Her two children inherited a lot of money from the farm land her second husband owned. 

Mervile Tucker was her first husband, WW2 Vet. He drove a taxi in Tville and built a house on Grandma White’s land. A nice house, stir there. I  used to go out with him when I was in grade school in the Taxi, smoked a pipe, half/half pipe tobacco. 

Ellen McWard

Yes. Lauren, her father died in a mining accident and her mother died shortly after. Aunt Reba always said she died of a broken heart. I don’t think I knew her name. 

Yes. That was her name. Didn’t realize it was three years. Lou was really young when she was went to live with grandma. I always try to see Sue Ellen when I go to Tville
