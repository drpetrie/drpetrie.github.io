# Preface

I embarked on this genealogy journey back in February 2012, over 13 years ago. It’s like a treasure hunt, an addictive pursuit of clues to piece together the missing puzzle pieces. Regrettably, I wish I had taken more interest in genealogy before my grandparents passed away. While research provides hard facts, it also misses a lot of the vibrant colors of life that were never captured. It’s incredibly frustrating to look at photos of ancestors without any identification, wondering who they are. Fortunately, my mom Charlotte has been incredibly helpful, allowing me to paint a much more comprehensive picture than I could have on my own.

I wasn’t sure how to organize this book. I tried my best to write it in a way that went beyond the dry facts of birthdates, marriage dates, and deaths. It was a slow process until I started using ChatGPT to help me craft a narrative around the tidbits of information I had. There will always be more story to tell, but I had to start somewhere.

I hope you enjoy this brief history of the Petrie family.
