Henry Clay Pate (1832-1911)

Early Life and Family Origins

Henry Clay Pate was born on 16 September 1832 in Conway, Arkansas. He came of age in a frontier region that was still forming its civil institutions and agricultural economy. Census records place him in the Hardin area of what later became Faulkner County by 1840, indicating that his family was established in central Arkansas during its early settlement period. The names of his parents are not presently documented, but Henry’s lifelong residence in the same locality suggests deep family roots in the area.

Marriage and Household

On 8 October 1854, Henry Clay Pate married Sarah Adeline Engelbright in Conway, Arkansas. Their marriage marked the beginning of a long-standing household centered in Union City, a rural community in what became Faulkner County. Together they raised a large family, reflecting both the agrarian lifestyle of the region and the expectations of mid-19th-century rural Arkansas.

Their known children were:

•	Lourena E. Pate

•	Francis “Fannie” Pate

•	Josephine Pate

•	Mollie (Mary) Pate

•	George Redmon Pate

•	Louis Hinkle Pate

Civil War Service and Allegiance

During the American Civil War, Henry Clay Pate served on the Confederate side, aligning with the prevailing loyalties of central Arkansas at the time. As the war drew to a close and Union authority was re-established in the region, he formally swore an oath of allegiance to the United States in 1864. This action allowed him to resume civilian life and maintain his property and standing within the community, a path taken by many former Confederate soldiers in Arkansas.

Later Years in Union City

Following the war, Henry returned to Union City, where he remained for the rest of his life. Census records from 1870, 1880, 1900, and 1910 consistently place him in the same community, reflecting a life defined by local ties rather than migration. By 1880 he was recorded as 45 years old, married, and heading his own household—an established family man in a settled rural area.

Death and Legacy

Henry Clay Pate died on 10 December 1911 in Faulkner County, Arkansas. He spent nearly his entire life in the same region where he was born, witnessing Arkansas’s transformation from frontier territory to post-Civil-War statehood society. His legacy endures through his children and descendants, and through a life that reflects the experience of many 19th-century Arkansans: rooted in place, shaped by war, and defined by family and community continuity.
