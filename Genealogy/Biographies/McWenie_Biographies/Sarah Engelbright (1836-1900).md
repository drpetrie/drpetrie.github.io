# Sarah Engelbright (1836-1900)

## Early Life and Family Background

Sarah Adeline Engelbright was born on 27 February 1836 in Conway County, Arkansas. She was the daughter of Lewis Englebright and his wife, Elizabeth. Family notes indicate that her father was reportedly born in London, England, suggesting an immigrant background that set Sarah within a household shaped by both Old World origins and frontier Arkansas life. Sarah spent her formative years in central Arkansas during a period when the region was still sparsely settled and largely agricultural.

## Marriage and Establishing a Household

On 8 October 1854, Sarah married Henry Clay Pate in Conway County, Arkansas. This marriage placed her at the center of a growing farm family in Union City, an area that would later fall within Faulkner County after its creation in 1873. As a young wife, Sarah took on the demanding role typical of mid-nineteenth-century frontier women—managing the household, supporting agricultural labor, and raising children in a rural setting with limited infrastructure.

## Motherhood and Family Life

Sarah and Henry Clay Pate were the parents of seven children: Lourena E. Pate, Francis “Fannie” Pate, Josephine Pate, Mollie Mary Pate, George Redmon Pate, Louis Hinkle Pate, and Henry Grant Pate. Census records consistently place Sarah with her family in Union City across multiple decades, reflecting a stable home base despite the challenges of frontier life. Her role as mother spanned years of economic uncertainty, westward settlement, and the social changes brought on by the Civil War and Reconstruction.

## Life in Union City, Arkansas

Census records document Sarah’s residence in Union City in 1860 and 1870, and again in 1880 and 1900, by which time the area was part of Faulkner County. In the 1880 census, she was recorded as a 44-year-old married woman and wife of the head of household. These records suggest continuity rather than migration, highlighting Sarah’s long-term commitment to family and place. Her life unfolded largely within the same community for over four decades, a pattern common among early Arkansas settler families.

## Final Years and Death

Sarah Adeline Engelbright Pate died on 11 November 1900 in Wooster, Faulkner County, Arkansas. She was buried in Faulkner County, closing a life that bridged early territorial Arkansas and the dawn of the twentieth century. Her legacy lived on through her children and grandchildren, many of whom carried the Pate family line into later generations across Arkansas and beyond.

## Legacy

Sarah’s life reflects the experience of many women of her generation: born into a frontier society, married young, and devoted to family, home, and community. Through decades of steady presence in Union City, she contributed quietly but substantially to the endurance of her family line. Her story anchors the Engelbright and Pate families firmly in the early history of central Arkansas.
