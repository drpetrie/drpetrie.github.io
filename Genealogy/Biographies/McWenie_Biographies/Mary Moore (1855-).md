# Mary Moore (1855-?)

## Early Life in Oneida County, New York

Mary Moore was born in 1855 in New York, the daughter of John Moore and Ann Moore. Census records place her childhood firmly in Whitestown, Oneida County, where she appears repeatedly from infancy through her teenage years. In 1855 she was listed as a child in her parents’ household, and by 1860 she was recorded at age five, still living in Whitestown. Subsequent enumerations in 1865 and 1870 continue to place her there, reflecting a stable upbringing within the same rural community during the mid-nineteenth century.

## Family and Household Background

Growing up in Whitestown, Mary was part of a working New York family during a period of significant economic and social change. Her repeated appearance in the same locality suggests continuity rather than migration during her formative years. The census consistently identifies her as a daughter in the household, indicating that she remained with her parents through at least age fifteen. No occupation is recorded for her in these early records, which is typical for unmarried daughters of the era.

## Marriage and Adult Life

By 1880, Mary had married James McWenie and was living in Utica, Oneida County, New York. The census lists her at age twenty-five, with marital status recorded as married and her relationship to the head of household noted as wife. This move from Whitestown to nearby Utica reflects a common transition from rural township life to a more urban setting, likely tied to her husband’s employment and the economic opportunities of the city.

## Motherhood and Family Legacy

Mary Moore and James McWenie were the parents of at least one known child, Edward John McWenie. Through her son, Mary became part of the McWenie family line that later extended beyond New York. While details of her later life, including the date and place of her death, remain unknown, her documented role as wife and mother anchors her firmly in the family’s early American narrative.

## Gaps in the Historical Record

After 1880, Mary Moore disappears from readily available census and vital records under that name. Her death date and place have not been identified, leaving an open question for further research. Nonetheless, the surviving records outline a clear life arc: a childhood rooted in Whitestown, a marriage that brought her to Utica, and a lasting legacy through her son and descendants.
