# Louranie Heath (1860-1907)

## Early Life in Tennessee (1860–1876)

Louranie Adkins Heath was born on 3 August 1860 in Medina, Gibson County, Tennessee, during the final year of the Civil War. She was the daughter of Henry Thomas Heath and Eliza Jane Campbell, and she spent her childhood in rural western Tennessee. Census records place her in Gibson County in 1870, where she grew up in a farming community shaped by postwar recovery and family labor.

By her mid-teens, Louranie had assumed adult responsibilities common to young women of the period, preparing for marriage and household management in a region where family and kin networks were central to survival and stability.

## Marriage to Ezekiel Hutson Holt and Early Widowhood (1876–1880)

On 18 December 1876, at the age of sixteen, Louranie married Ezekiel Hutson Holt in Gibson County, Tennessee. The young couple established their household locally, and by 1880 Louranie was recorded as a married wife in Gibson County.

Their marriage produced two children: John Henry Holt and Hattie Elizabeth Holt. The family’s stability was short-lived. Ezekiel Hutson Holt died in 1880, leaving Louranie a widow in her early twenties with two small children to support. His death forced an abrupt transition from young wife to single mother, a precarious position in the late nineteenth century South.

## Remarriage and a Blended Family (1881–1900)

Seeking stability for herself and her children, Louranie remarried on 18 October 1881 in Faulkner County, Arkansas, to Elisha Manson Hawkins. This marriage marked a geographic and social shift, moving her life center from Tennessee into Arkansas.

Together, Louranie and Elisha built a blended family that included her Holt children and three additional children born to the marriage: Fletcher Adkins Hawkins, Flora M Hawkins, and Thomas Weltch Hawkins.

By 1900, Louranie was living with her second husband in Union City, Faulkner County, Arkansas, recorded in the census as a married wife. Her household reflected the common realities of frontier and post-frontier life—children from multiple marriages, shared labor, and frequent relocation in search of opportunity.

## Final Years and Death in Texas (1900–1907)

Sometime after 1900, Louranie and her family moved south into Texas, settling in Ladonia, Fannin County. This move followed a broader regional pattern of families leaving Arkansas for North Texas at the turn of the twentieth century, often drawn by agricultural prospects and expanding rail connections.

Louranie Adkins Heath Hawkins died in October 1907 in Ladonia, Texas, at the age of forty-seven. Her relatively early death closed a life marked by early marriage, widowhood, remarriage, and the raising of children across two family lines and multiple states.

## Legacy

Louranie’s life reflects the resilience required of women in nineteenth-century rural America. She navigated widowhood at a young age, successfully reestablished a household through remarriage, and raised five children who carried forward the Holt and Hawkins family lines into Arkansas, Texas, and beyond. Her story anchors an important generational link between Tennessee roots and later Southern and Southwestern migrations.
