# Edward John McWenie (1911-1979)

## Early Life and Family Background (1911–1920)

Edward John McWenie was born on 9 December 1911 in Las Vegas, a long-established railroad and regional hub in northeastern New Mexico. He was the son of Edward John McWenie and Muriel Beveridge Hill, members of families already rooted in the Las Vegas area. Census records show Edward living with his parents in Las Vegas in 1920, reflecting a stable childhood spent within the same community where he was born.

## Growing Up in Las Vegas, New Mexico (1920–1935)

Edward spent his youth and early adulthood in Las Vegas, New Mexico, appearing in the 1930 census and again in local residence records in 1935. These years coincided with economic uncertainty nationwide, yet the McWenie family remained anchored in San Miguel County. Edward’s continued residence in Las Vegas through his early twenties suggests strong local ties and steady employment as he transitioned into adult life.

## Marriage and the Beginning of Family Life

Around 1930, Edward married Montine Adeline Pate. Together they established a household and later became parents to two children: Frederick James McWenie and Patricia Ann McWenie. Their marriage marked the beginning of Edward’s role as both provider and family head, responsibilities that would shape his later career and geographic mobility.

## Westward Moves: Texas and Arizona (1939–1950)

By 1939, Edward had relocated to El Paso, Texas, reflecting a period of transition and opportunity. Shortly thereafter, the family moved west to Tucson, Arizona. Census records from April 1940 list Edward as head of household in Tucson, with his wife present, and he remained there through at least 1950. This move aligned with broader mid-20th-century patterns of migration toward the Southwest, driven by expanding infrastructure and telecommunications industries.

## Career in Telecommunications

Edward built a long and successful career with the Mountain States Telephone Company, rising to the position of supervising foreman. His work placed him within one of the most critical utility sectors of the era, supporting the rapid growth of telephone networks across the Southwest. The supervisory role indicates technical skill, leadership ability, and long-term reliability within a major regional employer.

## Later Years and Death (1979)

In his later years, Edward relocated to Phoenix, Arizona. He died there on 12 September 1979, concluding a life that spanned the transition from early 20th-century regional communities to a modern, interconnected Southwest. Edward John McWenie’s life reflects steady progress—rooted beginnings in New Mexico, a stable family life, and a respected career in a foundational American industry.
