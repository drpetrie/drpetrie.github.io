# David Hill (1843-1928)

## Origins in Scotland (1843–1880)

David B. Hill was born in November 1843 in Scotland. Little is known of his early life, but his Scottish birth places him among the many 19th-century emigrants shaped by industrial change and limited opportunity at home. By 1880, David had made the decisive move to North America, joining the steady flow of immigrants drawn by economic prospects in the American West.

## Immigration and Entry into Colorado (1880)

David arrived in the United States in 1880 and quickly established himself in the mining regions of Colorado. That same year he was living in Georgetown, a booming mountain town at the heart of Colorado’s mining economy. His arrival coincided with the late phase of the silver and hard-rock mining era, an industry that would define his working life.

## Marriage and Family Life (1881–1890s)

On 12 October 1881, David married Agnes S. Beveridge in Arapahoe. Together they raised two daughters, Muriel Beveridge Hill and Heather Margaret Hill, anchoring their family during years marked by movement and economic uncertainty.

By 1885, David was still residing in Clear Creek County, continuing his involvement in mining. His work placed him among the skilled and semi-skilled laborers who sustained Colorado’s mineral economy long after its initial boom years.

## A Period in California (circa 1900)

By 1900, the Hill family had relocated to Temescal, in California. Census records show David listed as a married boarder, suggesting a transitional phase—possibly following work opportunities or adjusting after shifts in the mining economy. This move reflects the broader westward and inter-regional mobility common among mining families at the turn of the 20th century.

## Naturalization and Permanent Settlement (1904–1920)

David formally became a U.S. citizen in 1904, completing his naturalization in Denver. Shortly thereafter, he returned to the Colorado mountains, settling permanently in Idaho Springs.

Census records from 1910 and 1920 show David as head of household in Idaho Springs, indicating a stable and established family life. Idaho Springs, a long-standing mining community, provided continuity with the work David had known for decades.

## Final Years and Legacy (1920–1928)

David B. Hill remained in Idaho Springs until his death in 1928. He was buried there, closing a life defined by migration, labor, and perseverance. From his Scottish origins to the mining towns of Colorado and a brief interlude in California, David’s story reflects the experience of many immigrant miners who helped build and sustain the American West through hard, often uncertain work.
