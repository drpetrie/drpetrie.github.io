# Agnes Beveridge (1849-1928)

## Origins in Scotland (1849–1870)

Agnes S. Beveridge was born in August 1849 in Scotland. While specific details about her parents and early childhood have not yet been identified, her birth year places her childhood in mid-nineteenth-century Scotland, a period marked by economic pressure, industrialization, and steady emigration to North America. These broader conditions form the backdrop for her eventual decision to leave her homeland.

## Immigration to the United States (1870–1872)

Agnes immigrated to the United States in the early 1870s, with records indicating an arrival about 1870–1872. Like many Scottish immigrants of the period, she joined the growing flow of Europeans seeking opportunity in the American West. By the 1880s she was established in Colorado, part of a frontier society shaped by mining, railroads, and rapid town development.

## Marriage and Family Life in Colorado (1881)

On 12 October 1881, Agnes married David B. Hill in Arapahoe County, Colorado. David was also Scottish-born, and together they formed a household typical of immigrant families who blended Old World origins with Western opportunity.

The couple had two daughters:

•	Muriel Beveridge Hill
•	Heather Margaret Hill

Agnes’s middle name, Beveridge, was passed on to her daughter Muriel, reflecting a common practice of preserving maternal surnames within family naming traditions.

## Life in the Colorado Mining Communities (1885–1920)

By 1885, Agnes was living in Clear Creek County, Colorado, an area closely tied to mining and associated industries. Census records from 1900, 1910, and 1920 place her consistently in Idaho Springs, where she is recorded as a married woman and wife of the head of household.

Her repeated appearance in the same community across decades suggests stability and deep roots in Idaho Springs. Agnes’s adult life unfolded against the backdrop of a mining town that transitioned from boom-and-bust frontier conditions to a more settled community in the early twentieth century.

## Later Years and Death (1928)

Agnes S. Beveridge died in 1928 in Idaho Springs, Clear Creek County, Colorado. She was buried there, closing a life journey that began in Scotland and concluded in the Rocky Mountains of the American West. Her longevity allowed her to witness significant changes—from transatlantic migration to the maturation of Colorado’s mining towns.

## Legacy

Agnes Beveridge Hill represents the experience of many immigrant women whose lives are documented primarily through migration, marriage, and family. Though few personal details survive, her consistent presence in Idaho Springs over nearly half a century points to a life of endurance, family commitment, and adaptation. Through her daughters, particularly Muriel Beveridge Hill, her Scottish heritage and family name continued into subsequent generations.
