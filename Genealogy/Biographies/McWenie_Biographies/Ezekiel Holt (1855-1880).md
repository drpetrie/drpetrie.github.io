# Ezekiel Holt (1855-1880)

## Early Life and Family Background

Ezekiel Hutson Holt was born on 18 April 1855 in Gibson County, Tennessee. He was the son of John William Marshall Holt and Parthenia J. Umstead, members of a long-established rural Tennessee family. Ezekiel spent his entire life in Gibson County, growing up during the post–Civil War period in a region shaped by agriculture, reconstruction, and economic hardship.

Census records place him in Gibson County in both 1860 and 1870, where he was recorded at age fifteen, still living within his parents’ household. His upbringing reflects the typical experience of a farm-based Southern family in the mid-nineteenth century, with work, family, and church forming the core of daily life.

## Marriage and Young Family

On 18 December 1876, Ezekiel married Louranie Adkins Heath in Gibson County. Their marriage occurred when Ezekiel was just twenty-one years old, signaling an early assumption of adult responsibilities. The couple established their own household locally and went on to have two children:

•	John Henry Holt
•	Hattie Elizabeth Holt

Their family life unfolded entirely within the same Tennessee community where Ezekiel had been born and raised.

## Adult Life and Household

By the 1880 census, Ezekiel appeared as the head of his own household in Gibson County, reflecting his role as husband, father, and provider. While no specific occupation is recorded in the provided material, his circumstances strongly suggest agricultural or farm-related labor, consistent with both his family background and the economic structure of the area.

His adult life was brief but marked by the rapid progression typical of the era—childhood, marriage, parenthood, and household leadership compressed into less than a decade.

## Death and Burial

Ezekiel Hutson Holt died on 24 September 1880 in Gibson County, Tennessee, at only twenty-five years of age. His early death left his wife a young widow and his two children without their father. He was buried in Medina, Gibson County, Tennessee, remaining in death as in life within the same community that had defined his entire existence.

## Legacy

Though his life was short, Ezekiel Holt’s legacy continued through his children, particularly his daughter Hattie Elizabeth Holt, who would later connect the Holt family line to subsequent generations. His story is representative of many nineteenth-century rural Americans whose lives were rooted in one place, shaped by family obligations, and cut short before their full potential could unfold.

Ezekiel’s brief lifespan underscores both the fragility of life in the nineteenth century and the enduring impact of even a short life on the generations that followed.
