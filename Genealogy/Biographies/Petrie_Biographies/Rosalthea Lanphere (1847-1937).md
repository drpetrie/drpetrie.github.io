# Rosalthea Lanphere (1847-1937)

## Early Life in the Pennsylvania Lumber Country (1847–1867)

Rosalthea “Rose” Angelia Lanphere was born on 15 April 1847 at Bells Run in McKean County, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of Nimrod Lanphere and Sally Sarah Grow, members of an established American family whose roots in the northeastern United States reached back generations. During Rose’s childhood, McKean County was a frontier of heavy timbering and small farming communities, shaped by sawmills, rough roads, and seasonal labor tied to the forests.

Census records place Rose in Ceres Township, McKean County, in 1850 and again in 1860, with the family’s post office listed as Port Allegany. These years coincided with the height of Pennsylvania’s lumber era, when families balanced subsistence farming with wage work connected to logging and milling. Rose grew up in a household accustomed to hard work, mobility, and the rhythms of rural life—traits that would define her adult years.

## Marriage and Family Foundations in Pennsylvania (1867–1880)

On 18 March 1867, Rose married Oscar Cooper at Bells Run in McKean County. Their marriage marked the beginning of a long partnership that produced eight children: Nora Alice, Eva Luella, Sadie Harriet, Charles Calvin, Frank Nimrod, Nettie Belle, Omar Hartley, and Gladys Aurine Cooper. The naming of one son, Frank Nimrod Cooper, reflected Rose’s continued connection to her family of origin.

In 1870, Rose and Oscar were still living in Ceres Township, establishing their household amid familiar surroundings. By 1880, records suggest a period of transition: the family appears both in Ceres Township, Pennsylvania, and in Milton, Rock County, Wisconsin. This overlap reflects the reality of westward movement in the late nineteenth century, when families tested opportunities in new regions before fully relocating.

## Westward Across Wisconsin and the Dakotas (1880–1900)

By 1881, Rose and her family had settled in North Freedom, Sauk County, Wisconsin, part of a growing agricultural region fueled by railroad expansion. Within a few years, the Coopers joined the broader migration into the northern plains. In 1883 they were in North Dakota, and by November 1884 they had established themselves in Brown County, South Dakota.

Rose appears repeatedly in Brown County records throughout the 1880s and 1890s, including entries in 1884, 1889, and 1891, and in the 1900 census at Hecla, Brown County. These years coincided with the peak of homesteading in the Dakotas—a period marked by harsh winters, economic uncertainty, and demanding farm labor. As the mother of a large household, Rose’s work would have been unrelenting, encompassing childrearing, food production, and support of farm operations in a challenging environment.

## Later Years in North Dakota (1900–1930)

After 1900, Rose’s life continued to reflect movement within the northern plains. She was recorded in South Dakota in 1905, still married, before relocating again to North Dakota. By 1910 she was living in Cayuga, Sargent County, and by 1920 she appeared in Fairmount, Richland County, with an additional record in Ransom Township, Sargent County, suggesting close proximity to multiple children or extended family members.

The 1930 census places Rose in Fairmount, Richland County, North Dakota, where she was listed as widowed and living in the household of family members. By this stage of her life, Rose had witnessed the transformation of the frontier into established farming communities, the coming of railroads, and the maturation of towns across the Dakotas.

## Final Years and Burial (1937)

Rose spent her final years near family and died on 27 September 1937 in Henning, Otter Tail County, Minnesota. Although she died in Minnesota, she was buried the same day in Kingston, Sargent County, North Dakota, returning her to the region where much of her adult life had been spent.

## Legacy

Rose Lanphere Cooper’s life traces a clear arc of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American migration: from the wooded hills of northwestern Pennsylvania, across Wisconsin, and into the homesteading lands of the Dakotas. As a wife and mother of eight children, she anchored her family through repeated relocations and the demands of frontier farming. Her story reflects endurance rather than ease—decades of steady labor, adaptation, and family commitment that shaped the Cooper family’s presence in the Upper Midwest and northern plains.
