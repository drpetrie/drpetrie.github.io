# Mary Riha (1868-1943)

## Early Life in Bohemia (1868)

Mary Riha was born on 24 January 1868 in Bohemia, then part of the Austrian Empire and today within the Czech Republic. She was the daughter of Albert Vojtěch Riha and Eva Evaline Krejčová. Her birth came during a period of significant upheaval in Central Europe, when rural families faced land shortages, economic pressure, and limited opportunity. Like many Czech families of the era, the Riha family chose emigration as a practical solution rather than a romantic one.

Mary arrived in the United States later in 1868, still an infant. She had no memory of the old country, but her identity was shaped by parents who carried Bohemian language, customs, and Catholic traditions into their new American life.

## Childhood and Settlement in Iowa

By 1880, Mary was living with her family in Utica, Chickasaw County, Iowa, part of a growing Czech and Central European immigrant population in northeastern Iowa. The region offered fertile land and work opportunities, but life was demanding. Farm households relied on discipline, cooperation, and the labor of every family member, including children.

Census records from 1885 show Mary still in Utica and unmarried, suggesting she remained closely tied to her parents well into young adulthood. Her upbringing followed a familiar immigrant pattern: hard work, close-knit family life, and gradual assimilation into English-speaking American society while retaining ethnic roots.

## Marriage and Family Life

On 7 June 1887, Mary married Frank Louis Bartosh in Fort Atkinson, Winneshiek County, Iowa. The marriage united two Bohemian-American families and marked Mary’s transition from daughter to matriarch. Over the next several years, Mary and Frank built a large family, raising eight children:

•	Anna Elizabeth Bartosh
•	Frank Albert Bartosh
•	Joseph R. Bartosh
•	James T. Bartosh
•	Mary Eva Bartosh
•	John Frank Bartosh
•	Stella A. Bartosh
•	William Lawrence Bartosh

By 1900, the family was living in Grant City, Pocahontas County, Iowa, and by 1910 they had moved again to Jackson Township, Winneshiek County, Iowa. These moves reflect the reality of rural Midwestern life—families relocated as land, tenancy, or employment opportunities shifted.

## Westward to North Dakota

Sometime between 1910 and 1915, Mary and Frank joined the broader westward movement into the northern plains, settling in Casey Township, Ransom County, North Dakota. This move placed the family in a harsher environment, where weather extremes and economic uncertainty tested settlers. Farming and community survival required resilience, especially for women managing households, children, and often livestock while men worked fields or sought supplemental labor.

Mary’s life took a decisive turn when she was widowed prior to 1930. By that year’s census, she was living in Lisbon, Ransom County, North Dakota as the head of her household. This was no ceremonial title—Mary was responsible for maintaining her home and navigating old age without a husband, a reality faced by many frontier women but rarely documented in detail.

## Later Years and Death

Mary remained in Lisbon through the final decades of her life, appearing consistently in census records from 1930, 1935, and 1940. Despite advancing age, she maintained her independence, living as a widowed household head well into her seventies.

She died on 1 April 1943 in Lisbon, North Dakota, and was buried there the same day. Mary Riha Bartosh had lived through immigration, frontier settlement, motherhood on the plains, and widowhood during the Great Depression era.

## Legacy

Mary’s life was not marked by public office or recorded achievement, but by endurance. She represents a generation of Bohemian immigrant women whose labor anchored families and communities across the Midwest and Great Plains. Through her eight children and their descendants, Mary’s legacy extended far beyond the small towns where she lived, carrying forward the quiet strength of a woman who crossed continents—first as a child, then as a pioneer wife, and finally as a self-reliant matriarch of the North Dakota plains.
