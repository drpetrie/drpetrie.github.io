# Matthias Petri (1846-1925)

## From the Borderlands of Germany to the Frontier of Minnesota

In the final decade of the 19th century, amid the sweeping tide of European migration to America, the Petri family—then spelled Petry in official records—embarked on a life-altering voyage. On April 1, 1891, a German couple, Mathias and Katherine Petri, together with their children, disembarked from the steamship *Westernland* in New York City. The family had departed from Antwerp, Belgium, a major gateway for continental emigrants, particularly those from western Germany and the neighboring Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

The ship manifest listed the family as “laborers” from Germany, and they carried just four pieces of luggage between them. They were part of a broader migration wave fueled by hardship, hope, and the promise of land. Seven members of the Petri family crossed the Atlantic on that voyage. With modest means but resolute purpose, they stepped into a world filled with possibility and uncertainty. Their recorded destination was Albany, New York—a stepping stone in a journey that would ultimately lead them to the wilderness of Minnesota.

At the time, Ellis Island had not yet opened its famous gates. Instead, immigrants were processed at the Barge Office on the southern tip of Manhattan, a less iconic but equally vital portal. Here, the Petris underwent inspection and documentation before setting foot on American soil. One can imagine them stepping nervously onto the dock, burdened by fatigue and homesickness, yet stirred by hope and determination.

## Origins in Saarland: A Borderland Identity

Although definitive proof is elusive, a birth record from the Saarland region—near the border of Germany and Luxembourg—lists a Mathias Petry born February 12, 1856. His gravestone, however, states February 13, a discrepancy common in the 19th century, especially in border regions where linguistic, cultural, and political boundaries often blurred.

Saarland was a place of shifting sovereignties, mineral wealth, and complex identity. It had been contested in wars and treaties, its people shaped by both French and German influence. Most families lived by farming, mining, or trades, and the specter of conscription into imperial armies or the instability of rural economies pushed many to consider emigration. Mathias was likely among those who sought not just escape, but opportunity—a place to plant deep roots and provide a better future for his children.

## From the Steamship to the Prairie: Building a Life in Minnesota

After a short stay in the New York, the Petri family moved westward, likely via rail, settling first in Avon, Minnesota—a town already home to many German immigrants. This region near St. Cloud had fertile land and a growing ethnic community, offering both familiarity and fresh opportunity.

Homesteading in Minnesota meant clearing forest, tilling stubborn soil, and enduring brutally cold winters. It also meant freedom—something Mathias had likely never fully experienced in Europe. Over time, the family built log cabins and barns, planted crops, and forged friendships with neighboring families. Katherine likely tended a garden, preserved food, and raised the children while Mathias worked the land. Together, they shaped not just a homestead, but a life.

Minnesota’s northern lands were heavily forested, dotted with glacial lakes, and once home to the Ojibwe people. The area had only recently been opened for settlement through treaties and government policy. Under the 1862 Homestead Act, settlers could acquire 160 acres in exchange for five years of cultivation and residence. The Petris, like many, seized this chance to own land—a dream that had been out of reach in the old country.

## Trails Through Wilderness

Eventually, the family made their way north to Liberty Township in Beltrami County, a remote region still dominated by wilderness. The Petri men made the journey on foot from Park Rapids to Bemidji—nearly 50 miles—through forest, wetland, and deeply rutted trails left by logging carts. There were no proper roads, no inns, and few signs of settled life. What they found was raw land—and the chance to start again.

Once a claim was secured in Section 6 of Liberty Township, Mathias and his sons began the difficult task of taming the land. Trees had to be felled, stumps burned out, and stones cleared. Cabins were built by hand, water drawn from hand-dug wells, and fields gradually opened for crops. Winters brought deep snow and isolation, but the family endured with woodstoves, canned goods, and mutual aid from neighbors.

## A Patchwork of Immigrants

Liberty Township, like much of the surrounding region, was settled by a patchwork of European immigrants—Germans, Swedes, Norwegians, and Finns among them. They brought their languages, customs, and religions, forming tight-knit enclaves where Old World traditions met frontier realities.

German Lutherans built churches first, then schools and halls. Community events such as harvest festivals and barn dances offered respite from labor and reinforced social bonds. For families like the Petris, the German language remained a daily presence, and children often grew up bilingual. German-language newspapers circulated in Minnesota well into the 20th century, testifying to the strength of this cultural preservation.

## Farming the North

Farming in Beltrami County was no simple task. The land was uneven, often boggy, and frost could strike well into the spring. Still, the Petris planted oats, barley, and potatoes, raised livestock, and hunted or fished to supplement their diet. Fodder was cut by hand, and barns were insulated with hay or mud. Each task—slaughtering pigs, canning vegetables, splitting wood—was a family effort.

Women played vital roles, often combining domestic duties with fieldwork. Children were expected to contribute early, feeding animals, hauling water, and later attending small local schools during the winter months. The family relied on barter, mutual assistance, and seasonal work to make ends meet.

## Railroads, Logging, and Growth

By the early 1900s, logging companies pushed deeper into Minnesota’s forests, and rail lines followed. Timber camps offered temporary employment, while railroads connected remote farms with regional markets. Mathias and his sons likely did seasonal work in the woods, hauling logs or working in nearby mills. These jobs brought in cash, tools, and exposure to new ideas and technologies.

Towns like Bemidji grew rapidly, becoming hubs of trade and transport. For settlers, this meant better access to goods, postal services, and medical care. Churches expanded, and rural schools improved. The backwoods frontier was slowly transforming into a more connected, albeit still rugged, community.

## The Sons of Mathias: A Legacy in Four Branches

Mathias and Katherine had four sons, each carving a unique path across the continent:

• **John Petrie, Sr.**, the eldest, was the father of Robert Petrie. After his untimely death in a logging accident, his widow, Gertrude, remarried twice—first to John Erickson, and later to Champy Petri, John’s brother. Her resilience in raising the family is a testament to frontier survival.
• **Edward**, the second son, appears in the 1895 Minnesota State Census but disappears from the record thereafter. It’s unknown whether he died young, moved west, or changed his name. His absence adds an air of mystery to the family story.
• **Champy**, the third son, had a complicated personal life. He was married three times, ultimately marrying Gertrude, his brother’s widow. Such arrangements were not uncommon, born of practicality and the need for familial support in isolated communities.
• **Victor**, the youngest, moved to Ontario, Canada. Whether in pursuit of land, adventure, or independence, his branch of the family extended the Petri name beyond the U.S. border.

## Final Years: Hardship and Endurance

In 1921, Mathias suffered a debilitating stroke, leaving him confined to a wheelchair. Yet he remained on the land he had cleared decades earlier—a physical and spiritual anchor for his descendants. He lived out his final years surrounded by family and memory, a silent witness to the transformation of Liberty Township from wild forest to a network of farms and roads.

Though no longer able to work the fields, Mathias embodied the strength and sacrifice that built the community. His children and grandchildren carried on his legacy in both daily life and oral tradition.

## Reflections on the Petri Journey

The story of the Petri family is emblematic of the immigrant experience in America—a blend of risk, endurance, adaptation, and hope. From the contested borders of Saarland to the frozen soil of northern Minnesota, they left behind the old world with its constraints and carved out new lives with sweat, sorrow, and strength.

Their legacy is not simply written in census records or carved on gravestones. It lives in the stories passed down, the farms still tilled, the churches still standing. In remembering their journey, we honor their courage and renew our understanding of where we came from—and who we are.
