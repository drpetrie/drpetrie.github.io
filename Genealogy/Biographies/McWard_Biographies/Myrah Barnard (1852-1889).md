# Myrah Barnard (1852-1889)

## Early Life in Gloucestershire (1852–1871)

Myrah Barnard was born in 1852 at Plump Hill, Gloucestershire, the daughter of James Barnard and Sarah Dawes. She grew up in a rural corner of western England, an area shaped by agriculture and the woodland economy of the Forest of Dean. By 1871, census records place her living in East Dean, indicating continuity within the same local region during her formative years.

## Marriage and Family Life (1871–1889)

On 30 October 1871, Myrah married Enoch White at St John’s Church, Cinderford. Their marriage established a household rooted in the East Dean area, where Myrah would spend the remainder of her life.

Together they had six children:

•	John White
•	Sarah White
•	Thomas White
•	Sophia White
•	Philip White
•	James White

Census records from 1871 and 1881 show Myrah residing in East Dean, with the 1881 enumeration also referencing Westbury on Severn, suggesting either nearby residence or administrative overlap. Her years as a wife and mother were spent managing a growing family during a period of social and economic transition in rural Gloucestershire.

## Death and Burial

Myrah Barnard died in January 1889 in Gloucestershire, at approximately 37 years of age. She was buried on 13 March 1889 in Abenhall, a parish closely tied to the Barnard and White families. Her early death left six children, several still young, and marked a decisive turning point for the family.

## Legacy and Aftermath

Following Myrah’s death, her husband Enoch White emigrated to the United States, carrying their children’s futures into a new chapter across the Atlantic. Although Myrah herself never left England, her life directly shaped a family line that would become part of the broader story of English emigration to America in the late nineteenth century. Her legacy endures through her children and their descendants, bridging Gloucestershire and the American Midwest.
