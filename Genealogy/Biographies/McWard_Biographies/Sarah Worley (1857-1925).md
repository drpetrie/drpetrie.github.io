# Sarah Worley (1857-1925)

## Early Life in Kentucky

Sarah Palina Worley was born on 20 June 1857 in Marion County, the daughter of Henry W. Worley and Sarah J. Wayman. Her childhood unfolded in rural south-central Kentucky, where census records place her in the Bradfordsville area in both 1860 and 1870. These early years were shaped by farm life and close-knit family ties typical of post–Civil War Kentucky communities.

## Marriage and Migration to Illinois

On 13 January 1876, Sarah married Dennis O’Connell in Greene County. Following their marriage, the couple relocated from Kentucky to Illinois, part of a broader westward movement that promised land and opportunity. By 1880, Sarah was living in Athensville, newly married and beginning a long period of child-rearing and farm labor.

## Motherhood and Farm Life

Sarah Worley O’Connell was the mother of thirteen children:

•	Margaret
•	John H.
•	Laura
•	Mary Ellen
•	Honora “Nora” Catherine
•	Marshall M.
•	Luella
•	Sarah Ann
•	Thomas Othor
•	William Edward
•	Lillian C.
•	Nellie J.
•	Oran Oscar

Raising such a large family required resilience and constant labor. Family tradition records that Sarah worked as a turnip farmer alongside her husband, contributing directly to the household economy. Her life during these years was defined by agricultural work, childbirth, and the steady demands of frontier family life.

## Widowhood and Household Leadership

Dennis O’Connell died in 1897, leaving Sarah widowed at the age of forty. Rather than remarry, she assumed full responsibility for her household. Census records from 1900 and 1910 list her as head of household in Cahokia, an uncommon but telling detail that underscores her independence and authority within the family.

By 1920, Sarah was living in Carlinville, still identified as head of household. These years reflect a woman managing family affairs across changing residences, maintaining stability for her children despite the loss of her husband.

## Final Years and Death

In her final years, Sarah resided in Gillespie. She died there on 10 March 1925 at the age of sixty-seven and was buried two days later in the same community. Her life spanned the transition from antebellum Kentucky to industrial-era Illinois, marked by migration, hard farm work, widowhood, and the successful raising of a large family.

## Legacy

Sarah Palina Worley O’Connell’s legacy is one of endurance. Born in rural Kentucky, she became a matriarch in Illinois, guiding thirteen children into adulthood under often difficult circumstances. Her repeated listing as head of household after her husband’s death speaks plainly: she was not a background figure, but the central stabilizing force of the O’Connell family.
