# Marjorie White (1918-2001)

## Early Life in Central Illinois (1918–1935)

Marjorie Anne White was born on 19 October 1918 in Taylorville, Christian County, Illinois, into a working-class family shaped by the coal-mining economy of southern Illinois. She was the daughter of Philip White, a mine superintendent, and Mary O’Connell. Marjorie—often called “Margie” within the family—spent her earliest years moving between mining communities as her father’s work required.

In 1920, she was living in East Marion, Williamson County, Illinois, a region closely tied to coal production. By 1930, the family had returned to Taylorville, where Marjorie spent much of her childhood. Census and residence records from the 1930s place her consistently in Taylorville, indicating a period of relative stability during her formative years.

## Young Adulthood and Wartime Mobility (1935–1945)

By the late 1930s, Marjorie had entered adulthood during a period of national uncertainty shaped by the Great Depression and the approach of World War II. On 1 April 1940, at age 21, she was living in Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois, recorded as single and residing as a sister within the household—suggesting either employment, schooling, or family support drawing her away from Taylorville.

During World War II, Marjorie’s residences reflect the broad geographic mobility typical of the era. In 1942, she was living in Corpus Christi, Texas, a major naval and military hub during the war. By 1945, she was residing in Lakehurst, Ocean County, New Jersey, another location associated with military and defense activity. These moves place her squarely within the wartime domestic migration that reshaped American family life in the 1940s.

## Marriage and Family Life in Illinois (1945–1950)

Marjorie married Robert Darrel McWard, a lawyer and later judge from Taylorville. By 1950, census records show her living in Taylorville as a married woman and wife, marking the beginning of her life as the matriarch of her own household.

Together, Marjorie and Robert raised two children: Robert Gail McWard and Ellen Lou McWard. Her adult life during this period was rooted in family, community, and the civic-minded environment that accompanied her husband’s legal career.

## Later Years and Final Chapter (1950–2001)

In later life, Marjorie relocated to Arizona, as a result of failing mental health. She died on 13 October 2001 in Tucson, Pima County, Arizona, just days short of her 83rd birthday.

Despite her death in Arizona, Marjorie was buried in Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois—bringing her life story full circle to the state that had shaped her childhood, adulthood, and family legacy.
