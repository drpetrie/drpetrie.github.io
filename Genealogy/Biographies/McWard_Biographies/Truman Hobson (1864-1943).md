# Truman Hobson (1864-1943)

## Early Life and Family Background

Truman Ellsworth Hobson was born in 1864 in Ohio, a period when the Midwest was rapidly transforming through post–Civil War settlement, rail expansion, and the growth of regional towns. He was the son of John Talbot Hobson and Mary Elizabeth Brown. Truman grew up in a notably large family, with twelve brothers and sisters, an experience that likely shaped his sense of responsibility, cooperation, and public-mindedness from an early age.

## Migration to Illinois

Like many families of his generation, Truman left Ohio as opportunities drew people westward into Illinois. He settled in Taylorville, a growing county-seat town in Christian County that was emerging as a regional center for commerce, agriculture, and civic life. This move placed him squarely within a community that valued local leadership and civic engagement.

## Marriage and Family Life

In 1895, Truman married Zua Ella Lynn Logan. Their marriage anchored him further in the social fabric of Taylorville. While the record of their children is not fully detailed here, the size of Truman’s family of origin and his long-term residence in the community suggest a household closely connected to extended kin and local networks.

## Civic Leadership and Public Service

Truman Hobson’s most notable legacy was his service as Mayor of Taylorville, Illinois. Holding municipal office in a late–19th and early–20th century Midwestern town required practical leadership: overseeing local infrastructure, maintaining public order, and guiding civic growth during an era of modernization. His election to the mayoralty indicates that he was trusted by his neighbors and respected as a steady public figure in local government.

## Later Years and Death

Truman remained associated with Illinois for the rest of his life. He died in 1943 in Jacksonville, closing a life that spanned from the Civil War era into the midst of World War II. His years encompassed dramatic national change, yet his enduring contribution was local—rooted in family, community, and public service.

## Legacy

Remembered as a family man and civic leader, Truman Ellsworth Hobson represents a generation that built and sustained Midwestern towns through personal commitment and public duty. His role as mayor of Taylorville places him among those ancestors whose lives shaped not only their families but the civic institutions that served their communities for decades.
