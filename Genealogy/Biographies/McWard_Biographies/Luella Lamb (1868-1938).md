# Luella Lamb (1868-1938)

## Early Life and Family Background

Luella Lamb was born on 14 November 1868 in Illinois, the daughter of Oscar Lamb and Margaret Adeline Phenix. Later family notes suggest Ohio as her birthplace, but by 1880 Luella was firmly established in Christian County, Illinois, indicating that her family relocated west during her childhood. This movement fits a common late-19th-century pattern of Midwestern families seeking agricultural stability and opportunity.

In the 1880 census, Luella appears living in Ricks, Christian County, placing her in a rural township during her formative years. These early experiences likely shaped her lifelong familiarity with farm and small-town life.

## Marriage and the McWard Household

On 4 May 1887, Luella married Robert John McWard in Christian County, Illinois. Their marriage marked the beginning of a long partnership rooted in family, work, and community. Robert would later own an implement store, positioning the family within the commercial life of the county.

Together, Luella and Robert raised four children:

•	Elmer Richard McWard
•	Fannie McWard
•	Alpha Everett McWard
•	Lester Price McWard

Luella’s role centered on managing the household and raising their children while supporting her husband through frequent moves within Christian County as his business and opportunities evolved.

## Life in Christian County

Census records trace Luella’s life through several townships in Christian County. By 1900, the family was living in Greenwood Township, followed by Bear Creek Township by 1910. These repeated listings in 1910 reflect stable residence during that decade rather than multiple moves.

By 1920, Luella and her family had settled in Taylorville, the county seat, where she remained through 1930. This transition from rural townships to Taylorville mirrors a broader shift from agricultural settings to town-based living, often tied to business, education, and access to services.

## Later Years and Death

Luella spent her later years in Taylorville, surrounded by her children and grandchildren as the McWard family became well established in the community. She died on 15 September 1938 in Taylorville, Christian County, Illinois.

## Legacy

Luella Lamb McWard’s life reflects the experience of many Midwestern women of her era—marked by migration, marriage at a young age, child-rearing, and steady adaptation to changing economic and social circumstances. Through her children, particularly Elmer Richard McWard, her influence extended into subsequent generations, leaving a lasting imprint on the McWard family’s presence in Christian County.
