# Robert John McWard (1866-1950)

## Early Life and Family Origins

Robert John McWard (January 1866 – August 7, 1950) lived his entire life in central Illinois, where he bridged the agricultural world of the nineteenth century with the mechanized farming economy of the early twentieth century. His life reflects the steady, place-rooted experience of a Midwestern family shaped by land, enterprise, and community continuity.

Robert John McWard was born in January 1866 in Pawnee, during the immediate post–Civil War period, a time when Illinois agriculture was expanding rapidly. He was the son of Robert McWard, an Irish immigrant who arrived in the United States in 1858, and Margret McIntosh. Growing up in rural Illinois, Robert—often known as R.J.—came of age in a farming society that increasingly relied on machinery, improved transportation, and local commercial hubs.

Census records trace his childhood and early adulthood through Sangamon and Christian counties. By 1870 he was living in Pawnee, and by 1880 the family had moved to Ricks in Christian County. These moves followed the familiar pattern of internal migration within Illinois as families sought opportunity in newly developing townships and agricultural districts.

## Marriage and Children

Robert married Luella Lamb, born in Illinois in 1868, and together they raised four children: Elmer, Fannie, Alpha, and Lester McWard. Their family life unfolded alongside Robert’s growing involvement in the local farm economy. By the turn of the century, the McWards were settled in Greenwood Township, Christian County, where Robert established himself as a businessman.

## Establishing a Livelihood

From approximately 1904 to 1915, Robert operated an implement store in Palmer, located north of the local bank. At a time when horse-drawn equipment was giving way to mechanized farming tools, such stores were critical to the agricultural success of surrounding farms. His business placed him at the center of rural economic life, supplying equipment that supported productivity across Bear Creek Township and neighboring areas.

In 1911, Robert owned 80 acres of land in Bear Creek Township, just north of Palmer, underscoring his dual identity as both landowner and agricultural merchant. Ownership of farmland represented financial stability and social standing, and it tied the family directly to the land that defined their community.

## Later Years in Taylorville

By 1920, Robert and Luella had moved to Taylorville, where they remained for the rest of their lives. Census records show Robert living in Taylorville through 1930, 1935, 1940, and into 1950, reflecting a long period of stability in later life. Taylorville, as the county seat, offered greater access to services, churches, and social connections as the couple aged.

In his later years, Robert spent winters in Arizona, a common practice among older Midwesterners seeking relief from harsh winters. In 1950, while returning from Arizona, he was injured in an automobile accident. He died shortly thereafter on August 7, 1950, in Morrisonville. He was buried in Taylorville, the community that had been his home for three decades.

Robert John McWard’s life was not marked by dramatic migration or public prominence, but by consistency, enterprise, and rootedness. As the son of an Irish immigrant, a husband and father, a landowner, and an implement dealer, he represents a generation that quietly built the agricultural backbone of central Illinois—adapting to change while remaining firmly grounded in place and family.
