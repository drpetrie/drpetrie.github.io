# Sophia Anderson (1855-1905)

## Origins in Sweden (1855–1871)

Sophia Margaret Anderson was born on 16 December 1855 in Stockholm, the daughter of an Anderson and Martha Jansdotter. Her family name reflects Sweden’s patronymic tradition—Andersson indicating descent from a father named Anders—common across the country in the mid-nineteenth century. Although Stockholm offered urban opportunity, it was also a departure point for thousands leaving a nation strained by population pressure, limited farmland, and economic uncertainty.

Margaret came of age during the height of Swedish emigration. Between the 1860s and early 1900s, more than a million Swedes departed for North America. Young women, in particular, often traveled independently, drawn by demand for domestic labor and the promise of stability abroad.

## Crossing the Atlantic (1871)

In 1871, Margaret left Sweden, traveling the well-worn Scandinavian route through Hull and onward to Liverpool. From there she crossed the Atlantic, part of a recognized “wave of housemaids” whose labor underwrote early immigrant survival in American towns and camps. This journey—efficient but arduous—linked Baltic ports to British railways and steamship lines, depositing newcomers into a rapidly expanding United States.

## Marriage on the Western Frontier (1875)

Margaret married John W. Spence on 5 July 1875 in Toano, Elko County, Nevada. Toano—born of the railroad and already transient—was emblematic of the frontier world Margaret entered: temporary towns, hard labor, and rapid movement. John Spence, an English immigrant, worked as a teamster and later a homesteader, occupations that required mobility and resilience. Their marriage in such a place underscores how immigrant lives intertwined along the rails and supply routes of the American West.

## Building a Family Across the Plains and Pacific Slope (1875–1899)

Over the next quarter century, Margaret and John raised a large family—twelve children in all—while moving steadily west and north:

•	Nevada (1880): The family resided in Elko County, tied to transport and supply work.
•	North Dakota (1885–1888): In McLean County and elsewhere, Margaret reportedly worked in Bismarck, contributing economically while maintaining a growing household.
•	California (1889–1890): A brief stay in Butte County (Gridley) placed the family amid agricultural expansion.
•	Oregon (1892–1894): Continued movement followed opportunity as land and work shifted.
•	Washington (by 1899): The Spences finally settled in the Pacific Northwest.

This pattern—constant relocation in pursuit of land, wages, and stability—was typical of frontier families. Margaret’s role was central: managing births, illnesses, meals, and moves while anchoring family life amid uncertainty.

## Life in Washington and Final Years (1899–1905)

By 1900, the Spences were living in Fruitvale, Yakima County, Washington, and soon after in the Milan area of Spokane County. Here, the long westward arc finally slowed. Swedish cultural threads—Lutheran faith, foodways, and community ties—were strong in the region, offering a measure of familiarity after decades of movement.

Margaret died on 17 December 1905 in Milan, Spokane County, just one day after her fiftieth birthday. She was buried locally, closing a life defined by migration, labor, and family.

## Legacy

Sophia Margaret Anderson Spence’s story mirrors that of many Scandinavian women who quietly shaped the American frontier. From Stockholm to the deserts of Nevada, the plains of North Dakota, the farms of California and Oregon, and finally the forests of Washington, she bore the physical and emotional weight of settlement. Her twelve children carried forward a legacy rooted in endurance and adaptability—proof that the westward expansion of a nation was built as much by women’s steady hands as by railroads and homesteads.
