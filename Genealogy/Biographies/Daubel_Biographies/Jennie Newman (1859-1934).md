# Jennie Newman (1859-1934)

## Early Life in Western New York (1859–1875)

Jeanette “Jennie” Lydia Newman was born on 12 December 1859 in Freedom, a rural farming community in western New York. She was the daughter of Franklin H. Newman and Hannah Elizabeth Easton, growing up during a period when family labor, small farms, and close-knit households defined daily life. Census records place her in Freedom in 1860 and later in Farmersville by 1870, reflecting the modest internal moves common among agricultural families in the region.

By June 1875, Jennie was living in Freedom as a stepdaughter in her household, suggesting family restructuring after the loss or remarriage of a parent—an experience that shaped many young women of her generation and often accelerated early adulthood responsibilities.

## Marriage and the Beginning of a Westward Life

On 3 July 1875, at just fifteen years old, Jennie married Walter Ezra Strong in Farmersville, Cattaraugus County, New York. Their marriage coincided with one of the most significant population shifts in American history: the westward movement toward opportunity in the Pacific Northwest.

Like many young couples of the era, Jennie and Walter looked beyond the limits of established eastern farmland. Within a decade, they joined the flow of families heading west, carrying with them children, household goods, and the practical skills needed to start over on the frontier.

## Establishing a Family in Washington Territory (1887–1900)

By 16 May 1887, Jennie was recorded as married and living in Spokane, a rapidly growing railroad and commercial hub in eastern Washington. Spokane in the late 1880s was a place of upheaval and opportunity, shaped by railroads, timber, mining, and a steady influx of settlers.

The Strong family soon moved north into Stevens County, an area still defined by logging camps, homesteads, and newly surveyed towns. By 1892 they were established there, and by 1900 Jennie was living in Clayton, anchoring a large and growing household.

Jennie gave birth to seven children:

•	Franklin Dewitt Strong
•	Grace Ruby Strong
•	Mattie Pearl Strong
•	William “Will” Henry Strong
•	Ethel May Strong
•	Guy Alfred Strong
•	Carl “Carlie” F. Strong

Raising such a large family in frontier Washington required endurance and discipline. Jennie’s life revolved around child-rearing, food preservation, household management, and supporting her husband’s work, all while adapting to the demands of a developing region.

## Later Years in Riverside and Enduring Family Bonds (1900–1934)

From 1910 through 1930, Jennie resided in Riverside, where she spent the bulk of her later life. By then, the frontier years had given way to more settled communities, but daily life still required resilience, especially for women who had spent decades raising children and maintaining households.

Family memory preserves Jennie not just as a pioneer wife and mother, but as a beloved grandmother. One descendant recalled that “Grandma Thressa was close with her Grandma Jenny,” a simple statement that speaks volumes about Jennie’s role as a steady, affectionate presence within the extended family.

## Death and Burial

Jennie Newman Strong died on 1 May 1934 in Spokane, at the age of 75. She was buried in Deer Park, returning in death to the region where she had spent most of her adult life.

Her life traced a classic American arc: born in rural New York, married young, carried west with the tide of settlement, and grounded in the demanding work of family and community. Through her children and grandchildren, Jennie’s legacy continued well beyond the years she spent carving out a life on the edge of the American frontier.
