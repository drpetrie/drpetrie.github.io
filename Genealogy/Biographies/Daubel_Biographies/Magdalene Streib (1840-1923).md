# Magdalene Streib (1840-1923)

## Early Life in Württemberg (1840–1867)

Magdalene Christiane Streib was born on 10 July 1840 in Bonfeld, a small agricultural village in the Kingdom of Württemberg. She was the daughter of George (Georg) Michael Streib and Christiana Deck, members of a rural German society shaped by small farming, village trades, and Lutheran parish life.

Bonfeld in the mid-19th century was a tightly knit community where families often remained for generations. Daily life was labor-intensive, structured by the agricultural calendar, and constrained by limited economic opportunity. Like many young women of her generation, Magdalene’s future would be defined largely by marriage, motherhood, and the management of a working household.

## Marriage and Family in Germany (1867–1882)

On 31 January 1867, Magdalene married Ludwig Daubel in Bonfeld. Their marriage united two local families at a time when Germany was undergoing political consolidation and economic change. Over the next fifteen years, Magdalene gave birth to six children:

* Henry (Heinrich) Daubel
- Phillip Daubel
- Louie Johann Ludwig Daubel
- Charles Daubel
- August Daubel
- Sophia Elisabeth Daubel

Raising a large family in rural Württemberg required constant work. Magdalene’s responsibilities would have included food production and preservation, textile work, child-rearing, and support of her husband’s trade. By the late 19th century, however, population pressure, limited land, and economic uncertainty were pushing many German families to consider emigration.

## Emigration to America (1882)

In 1882, Magdalene emigrated from Germany to the United States with her family. Passenger records confirm her parentage, identifying her father as Georg Michael Streib, an important detail that anchors her German origins.

The decision to leave Württemberg was not casual. It meant abandoning extended family, language, and familiar customs in exchange for uncertainty. For Magdalene, the journey involved weeks of travel, first to a European port and then across the Atlantic by steamship, followed by inland rail travel across an unfamiliar continent.

## Life on the Kansas Frontier (1880s–1890s)

By 1895, Magdalene was living in Charleston, part of a growing German-American farming region. Life on the Kansas plains was demanding. Homes were modest, weather extremes were severe, and farm families relied heavily on one another for survival.

As her sons reached adulthood, they increasingly took on farm labor and began laying the groundwork for their own futures. Magdalene’s role as matriarch was central—maintaining the household, preserving cultural traditions, and holding the family together during years of physical hardship and economic risk.

## Westward to Washington State (1900–1923)

Following her children’s westward movement, Magdalene relocated to eastern Washington. By 1910 and 1920, she was living in Chattaroy, a rural community north of Spokane where her sons had established farms on former railroad lands.

In her later years, Magdalene lived within a family network shaped by logging, farming, and frontier resilience. Despite advancing age, she remained part of an active immigrant household, witnessing the transformation of raw land into productive farms and permanent communities.

Magdalene Christiane Streib Daubel died on 11 July 1923 in Elk, one day after her 83rd birthday.

## Legacy

Magdalene’s life traced a clear arc of 19th-century German immigrant experience: village origins in Württemberg, transatlantic migration, frontier hardship in Kansas, and final settlement in the Pacific Northwest. Through six children, she became the matriarch of a large Daubel family whose roots spread deeply into northeastern Washington.

Her story is not one of public distinction, but of endurance—measured in miles crossed, children raised, and communities built. Magdalene Streib’s legacy survives in the generations that followed her west, carrying forward the quiet strength that sustained one family across two continents.
