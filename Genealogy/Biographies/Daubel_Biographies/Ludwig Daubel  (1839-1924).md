# Ludwig Daubel (1839-1924)

*From Bonfeld to the American Frontier*

## Origins in Bonfeld, Württemberg

Nestled among the rolling hills and vineyards of Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the small village of Bonfeld had long been home to farming families rooted in tradition and craftsmanship. In the 19th century, Bonfeld was part of the Kingdom of Württemberg, a region steeped in Lutheran faith, order, and duty. Its citizens were subject to the expectations of a militarized state, where young men were regularly called into military service and entire families faced rigid social structures. It was here, in 1839, that Ludwig Daubel was born—a child of this agrarian world and, eventually, one of its quiet revolutionaries.

Ludwig grew up in a community where generations tilled the same fields and hammered iron on the same anvils. He apprenticed as a blacksmith, a respected and essential trade in rural Württemberg. Blacksmiths provided horseshoes, plowshares, tools, and hardware, keeping the local economy turning in a time before industrial mass production reached the countryside. Ludwig became skilled in his craft, supporting his family while serving his community with strength and discipline.

But as the decades progressed, the political atmosphere in Germany grew increasingly tense. The military draft bore down on Ludwig’s sons, threatening to take them into a life he no longer believed in. Alongside rising nationalism and economic instability, these pressures led Ludwig to seek an alternative—one that would offer freedom, land, and safety for his children. With determination, he began preparing for emigration.

## Emigration and Discharge from Württemberg

Leaving Germany in the 1880s was no simple task. Citizens of Württemberg were not free to abandon their homeland without formal discharge. Ludwig had to apply to the Royal Württemberg Government of the Neckar District for release from his obligations, including military service and tax liabilities. His successful application was a milestone, symbolizing his family's separation from generations of deeply rooted ties to German soil and state.

At the time of departure, Ludwig had saved 3,000 marks—an impressive amount, equivalent to about $20,000 in today's currency. This financial security demonstrated his readiness for the enormous risk ahead. With the blessing of the state and his worldly goods in tow, Ludwig and his family boarded a ship bound for America in 1885. Their destination: a growing German enclave on the plains of Kansas.

## Settling in Kansas: Hanover and the German Enclave

The Daubels first settled in Hanover, Kansas, in Washington County, a town known for its significant German-speaking population. The region welcomed them with a familiar language, shared values, and churches where hymns echoed the same liturgies as Bonfeld. Ludwig quickly resumed work as a blacksmith and mason, contributing to the new settlement by building stone foundations and repairing iron tools for neighboring farmers.

Life on the Kansas prairie was different from Germany but filled with hope. The family lived among friends and relatives, raising crops, attending church, and gradually adapting to American customs. Ludwig’s children went to school and learned English while maintaining their Swabian dialect at home. Ten years in Kansas gave them a chance to root themselves in the New World.

Yet the Daubels were not content to stop there. Word came from the Pacific Northwest of cheap land and opportunities to build anew. The call of the frontier stirred again in Ludwig’s heart—and in the hearts of his sons.

## Westward Movement: The Daubel Sons Pioneer in Washington

By the early 1890s, Ludwig’s sons began moving west. Henry and Phillip were the first, lured by tales of fertile land, towering pine forests, and opportunity in Oregon and Washington. Phillip settled in Thurston County, Washington, where he worked and raised a family. Soon, August, Louie, and Charles followed, establishing themselves in the Elk area of Spokane County.

The railroad was selling land for as little as $2.50 an acre, and the promise of ownership was irresistible. But this was no easy land—it was covered in dense forest and strewn with boulders. Still, the Daubel brothers were determined. With grit and determination, they cut trees, cleared fields, and built homes from the land they claimed. Each brother took up his own homestead, creating a web of family farms that would define the community for generations.

The family’s belongings—plows, wagons, blacksmithing tools, and household goods—were shipped by train. When they arrived, neighbors helped each other unload and set up. The Daubel farms began to take shape, complete with orchards, livestock, and sawmills. They built not just cabins, but a community.

## Ludwig’s Journey to the Pacific Northwest

Eventually, Ludwig and the rest of the family left Kansas to join their sons in Washington. The trip would have been arduous, involving days of train travel and multiple stops. Yet Ludwig’s arrival in Elk marked the fulfillment of a dream: a united family, settled on their own land, beyond the reach of war or military drafts.

In Elk, Ludwig found a new rhythm. Though older, he still practiced his trade, helping his sons repair wagons and tools, and contributing to the family’s sawmill and farming operations. He witnessed firsthand the transformation of wilderness into thriving homesteads, the laughter of grandchildren playing in the orchards, and the rewards of the risks he had taken decades before.

## Legacy of Ludwig Daubel

Ludwig Daubel died in 1924, having lived through a century of change. He saw the industrialization of Germany, the promise of the American frontier, and the rise of his descendants across two continents. His life was one of vision and perseverance—qualities passed down to his children and grandchildren.

He left behind more than tools and property. He left a model of courage, the belief that change was possible, and the will to protect family at all costs. The Daubel name lives on in the farms and families of Elk, in the stories told at reunions, and in the ironwork and stonework that still survive today.

His journey—from a village blacksmith in Bonfeld to the patriarch of a pioneering family in Washington—is a powerful testament to the immigrant experience, the value of skilled labor, and the strength found in the bonds of kinship.
