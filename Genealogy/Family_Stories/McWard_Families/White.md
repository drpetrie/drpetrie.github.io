# The White Family

## Origins in Europe

The White family traces its roots to East Dean in Gloucestershire, England, a region rich in coal and iron mining history. Located in the Forest of Dean, this rural area has long been associated with mining, agriculture, and timber. Enoch White was born there in 1850 to John White and Jane West. Both Enoch and his father were engaged in the mining industry—a fact documented in census records and marriage licenses. The tradition of mining was a defining element of the family’s early life, part of a broader pattern among working-class English families of the mid-19th century who sought economic stability through industrial labor.

## Emigration to America

Enoch White made multiple transatlantic journeys between England and the United States, beginning as early as 1872. He made subsequent trips in 1880, 1884, and 1889, suggesting that he may have worked as a contract laborer or was testing the waters before relocating his entire family. His first son was born in Pennsylvania, indicating at least one significant period of residence in the United States before returning to England. Ultimately, the family emigrated permanently to Illinois in 1889, settling in Christian County where coal mining opportunities were abundant.

Enoch’s transatlantic mobility exemplifies the migratory experience of many working-class families in the late 19th century. Coal mining was booming in Illinois, and families like the Whites brought with them the skills, discipline, and traditions that sustained frontier mining towns.

## Life on the American Frontier

Once in Illinois, the White family became part of the tightly knit mining communities that fueled the region’s economy. Enoch continued his work in the mines, passing along his experience to his son, Philip White, born in East Dean in 1879.

Philip became a mine superintendent, ultimately overseeing operations in multiple coal mines, including those in Taylorville and West Frankfort. His career culminated in a tragic end. On July 28, 1920, Philip was leading an inspection team in the aftermath of a mine fire at By-Products Coke Corporation’s Mine No. 18 in West Frankfort. Despite not being required to enter the mine himself, he chose to do so, and his oxygen apparatus failed due to vomit clogging the mica valves. He was overcome by smoke and suffocated. The president of Peabody Coal traveled from St. Louis for his funeral and assured his widow, Mary O’Connell White, that the company would take care of the family—including offering college tuition for the children.

Mary chose a large house on Main Street in Taylorville for herself and their six children. It stood across the street from the more modest home later occupied by her daughter Marjorie and son-in-law Robert Darrel McWard.
