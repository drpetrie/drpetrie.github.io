# The Hobson Family

## Origins in America

The Hobson family’s American story begins in the state of Ohio in the early 19th century. While the precise immigration details of the earliest Hobson ancestors remain unclear, it is likely that the family descended from English settlers who arrived in the United States in the colonial or early federal period. The surname “Hobson” itself is of English origin, meaning “son of Hob,” a diminutive of Robert, and was relatively common in northern England.

By the mid-1800s, the Hobsons were firmly rooted in Ohio, a state that had only recently emerged from the frontier era and had become a center for agriculture and trade. John Talbot Hobson and his wife Mary Elizabeth Brown raised a large family there—reportedly 13 children—including their son Truman Ellsworth Hobson, born in 1864. Their presence in Ohio placed them in a state deeply affected by the Civil War, industrialization, and postwar reconstruction.

Truman later moved westward to Taylorville, Illinois, part of a broader pattern of migration as families sought new farmland, civic opportunity, and economic growth in the heart of the Midwest.

## Life on the American Frontier

Taylorville, located in Christian County, Illinois, was a growing town in the late 19th century, shaped by agriculture, railroads, and civic ambition. Truman Hobson became one of the town’s leading citizens. After marrying Zua Ella Lynn Logan in 1895, he began a life of public service, eventually serving as mayor of Taylorville. His tenure would have involved leadership during a transformative period: roads were being paved, electricity and telephones introduced, and local governance was adapting to the demands of the Progressive Era.

Zua Logan, his wife, likely came from a similarly rooted Illinois family. Together they raised their children in a community-centered environment, closely tied to the civic and social life of Taylorville. Their home on West Market Street became a gathering place not only for family events but for public affairs, particularly during Truman’s time in office.

Their daughter Helen was born into this vibrant world in 1897. She would remain in Taylorville her entire life, a symbol of the Hobson family’s deep roots in the town they helped shape.

## Family Life and Legacy

Marriage was both a social and strategic alliance in small-town America. When Helen Hobson married Elmer McWard in 1917, it united two prominent families of Christian County. The wedding, held in the Hobson home, was a well-attended affair officiated by Rev. W. S. Rounds and followed by a dinner and honeymoon trip to Chicago. These details, preserved in newspaper clippings, reflect the social standing of the couple and the tradition of community observance.

Helen studied voice under an instructor from Millikin University and was a member of the Woman’s Glee Club, indicating the Hobson family’s emphasis on education, culture, and civic participation. She remained active in church and musical activities throughout her life.

Her marriage to Elmer also placed her in a unique role. Elmer served as Sheriff of Christian County, and the couple lived in the sheriff’s residence above the jail on 301 W. Franklin Street. Helen cooked meals for the inmates and maintained a household that was simultaneously a public institution. During a jail break incident, she and her grandson were swiftly moved to safety, showing both the hazards and community trust placed in the family.

Helen and Elmer had two children: Gail and Robert Darrel McWard. Their son Robert would continue the legacy of civic service, becoming a lawyer and judge in Taylorville. Through these generations, the Hobson family story reflects a legacy of leadership, education, and commitment to local life.
