# The McWard Family

## Origins in Europe

The McWard family traces its origins to County Donegal in northwest Ireland, a rugged and Gaelic-speaking region shaped by centuries of clan life, British colonization, and agrarian struggle. The surname "McWard" is believed to derive from the Gaelic "Mac an Bhaird," meaning "son of the bard," suggesting ancestral ties to a learned class of poets and chroniclers.

Robert McWard was born on January 1, 1837, in Donegal. He and his wife, Margaret McIntosh—also Irish-born in 1842—emigrated to the United States in the late 1850s. While no ship or port is recorded, an anecdote passed down through the family indicates that Margaret sewed garments for President Lincoln's 1861 inauguration, placing their arrival in the U.S. shortly before the Civil War. Their early life in America was shaped by the challenges of immigrant settlement and the opportunities presented in the American Midwest.

## Emigration to America

Robert and Margaret settled first in the Horse Creek area near Pawnee, Illinois, a growing agricultural community in the 1860s. By 1873, they had relocated to Christian County, establishing themselves in Ricks Township southeast of Morrisonville. In 1881, they purchased a 160-acre homestead east of Morrisonville, which became the family’s primary residence.

Robert worked as a farmer, contributing to the expanding agricultural economy of central Illinois. His ability to secure and cultivate land reflected the opportunities afforded by the Homestead Act and post-Civil War development.

## Life on the American Frontier

As settlers on the Illinois prairie, the McWards participated in the transformation of raw land into productive farms and organized communities. In a time of horse-drawn plows, rural schools, and small-town churches, they helped shape the social and economic fabric of Christian County.

Robert passed away in 1908 at the family homestead. Margaret, widowed, moved into the town of Palmer where she lived until her death in 1929. Their story is emblematic of many Irish immigrant families who persevered through hardship to secure land, raise families, and build enduring legacies.
