# The Hill Family

## Origins in Europe

The Hill family traces its ancestry to Scotland, a country known for its rugged terrain, resilient people, and industrious traditions. David B. Hill, born in 1843, likely grew up amid the industrial expansion of mid-19th-century Scotland, where coal and mineral mining shaped the working-class economy. Scotland’s long history of emigration in the 1800s was driven by economic pressures, the Highland Clearances, and the lure of opportunity in the expanding American West. David Hill was one of many Scots who ventured abroad to find work in the mines of the Rocky Mountains.

##  Emigration to America

David B. Hill immigrated to the United States around 1865, arriving in the mountainous regions of Colorado during a booming period of mining development. Colorado was transitioning from frontier territory to statehood (which it achieved in 1876), and mining towns like Georgetown and Idaho Springs were bustling with prospectors, engineers, and laborers.

Hill settled in Georgetown, a major silver mining town, and later moved to Idaho Springs—another key hub in Colorado’s mining belt. These communities were at the heart of the Colorado Silver Boom and offered steady work to skilled miners like Hill. His Scottish roots and mining expertise made him well-suited for the demanding labor of high-altitude, deep-shaft mining.

## Life on the American Frontier

David Hill married Agnes Beveridge, likely also of Scottish descent, and together they raised their family in the mountain towns of Colorado. Their daughter, Muriel Beveridge Hill, was born in Georgetown in 1883. Life in these towns was physically challenging but culturally vibrant, with schools, churches, and town halls springing up among the steep mountain passes and river valleys.

Muriel grew up in this frontier environment but pursued higher education—an ambitious path for women of her time. She attended Colorado College in Colorado Springs in 1901 and earned a degree in education. Her migration from Colorado to New Mexico marked a shift from frontier mining towns to emerging educational centers in the Southwest.
