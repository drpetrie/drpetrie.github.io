# The Holt Family

## Origins in America

The Holt family line in this history begins in Gibson County, Tennessee, a region of the South shaped by cotton agriculture and antebellum migration. Ezekiel Hutson Holt was born in 1855 in Gibson, Tennessee, during a period of national expansion and mounting sectional tensions in the United States. He was the son of John William Marshall Holt and Parthenia Umstead—names that reflect Southern Protestant traditions and early American settlement culture. The family likely engaged in small-scale farming, as was typical of west Tennessee homesteads in the pre-Civil War era.

Ezekiel came of age during Reconstruction, a time of profound transformation in the South as former Confederate states rebuilt their economies, political systems, and social structures. In this environment, young men like Ezekiel would have been shaped by agricultural labor, limited educational infrastructure, and the rhythms of farm life.

## Life on the American Frontier

Ezekiel married Louranie Heath and had at least two children: John Henry Holt and Hattie Elizabeth Holt. Tragically, Ezekiel died young in 1880 at just 25 years old, leaving Louranie to raise their children in post-Reconstruction Tennessee. The family remained in Gibson County for a time, but eventually, they joined the broader pattern of migration westward in search of economic opportunity and open farmland.

Hattie Holt, born in 1879 in Medina, Tennessee, grew up in the wake of her father’s early death. Her childhood would have been shaped by rural southern culture—faith, family, farming, and resourcefulness. In 1898, she married George Redmon Pate in Wooster, Arkansas, and began a new life that would span four states and over six decades.

George and Hattie raised their large family in Arkansas and later moved to New Mexico, living near Lake Arthur in Chaves County. The region was developing rapidly in the early 20th century due to irrigation projects and agricultural expansion. Eventually, Hattie followed her children to West Texas, settling in Odessa in the mid-1960s.

## Family Life and Legacy

Hattie and George Pate had ten children—Hazel, Redmon, Henry French, Charles “Z,” Ray, Montine, Rupert, Francis, Annie, and Georgie—a testament to both their devotion to family and the cultural norm of large households in rural America.

Hattie’s legacy is remembered in many ways. She was a strong and steady presence, the matriarch of a growing family that spread across the Southwest. One grandchild recalled that she enjoyed watching professional wrestling—an unexpected detail that adds life and personality to a woman who had seen enormous change in her lifetime.

She lived with her daughter Georgie Pate in Odessa, Texas, and passed away in 1967 at the age of 87 after a long illness. Her funeral was held at the First Methodist Church in Artesia, New Mexico, and she was buried in Woodbine Cemetery, a final resting place in the town where she had lived for over two decades. A member of the Methodist Church, Hattie embodied the values of faith, resilience, and familial love.
