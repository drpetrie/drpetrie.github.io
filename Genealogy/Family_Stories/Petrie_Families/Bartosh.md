# The Bartosh and Reha Families

## Origins in Europe

The Bartosh and Reha families came from the Písek region of southern Bohemia, in what is now the Czech Republic. Their home village of Neznašov, nestled near the Vltava River, was typical of rural Czech communities—devoutly Catholic, agrarian, and shaped by centuries of Habsburg rule. Family tradition and village bonds were strong, as were the seasonal rhythms of planting, harvest, and religious festivals.

Frank Louis Bartosh was born in Neznašov on August 2, 1864. When he was just seven months old, his family emigrated to America, joining a wave of Czech-speaking families who settled in the farmlands of Iowa. Mary Eva Reha, his future wife, was also born in Bohemia and immigrated as a young girl. The Rehas were part of the same immigrant network, maintaining language and customs while adapting to life in the American Midwest.

## Life on the American Frontier

Frank and Mary married in Iowa on June 7, 1887, and raised their large family in the Czech-American farming communities of the state. They had nine children, all born in Iowa. The family kept Czech traditions alive, speaking the language at home, attending Catholic Mass, and passing down recipes, music, and folk stories.

In 1911, the Bartosh family moved to North Dakota, drawn by the promise of land. They settled near Lisbon, in Sargent County, and began farming the plains. Life was difficult: harsh winters, droughts, and economic pressures demanded persistence. But the family endured, carving out a livelihood and helping to establish Czech-American identity in the Dakotas.

Frank died in Lisbon on July 14, 1919, after a life of steady labor and fatherhood. Mary lived on, remembered as a quiet but steady presence in her children’s lives. Their daughter Anna Bartosh would go on to marry Charles Cooper, tying the Bartosh and Cooper lines together and bringing their story into the Minnesota and Washington branches of the family.
