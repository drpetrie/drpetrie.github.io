# The Petrie Family

## Origins in Europe

The Petri family hailed from the border region spanning Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium—an area marked by shifting boundaries and cultural overlap. In the late 19th century, this tri-national region was shaped by the iron mining boom, especially in towns like Rumelange, Luxembourg, and nearby parts of Saarland, Germany. Families in this region often spoke multiple languages and lived in communities enriched by migration, labor, and Catholic tradition. The Petri family lived and worked in several locations across this region before emigrating to the United States in pursuit of better opportunities.

John Petri was born in Rumelange, Luxembourg, on August 24, 1875. His father, Mathias Petri, had been born in Saarland, Germany, and his mother, Katherine Riel, was also German-born. Facing economic pressures and a changing industrial economy, Mathias and Katherine prepared for a bold move to the United States in pursuit of greater opportunity for their children.

## Emigration to America

In April 1891, Mathias Petri and his family emigrated aboard the ship *Westernland*, which sailed from Antwerp, Belgium, to New York. They arrived with seven individuals, listed as laborers, carrying four pieces of luggage. The family passed through the Barge Office in New York—preceding the Ellis Island era—and were recorded as headed to Albany, New York.

They soon made their way to Avon, Minnesota, where Mathias and John both filed homestead claims in the late 1890s. Liberty Township in Beltrami County offered land and timber to clear, and the two men walked from Park Rapids to Bemidji along rugged trails to claim their farms. Mathias settled in Section 6, and John near Long Lake.

## Life on the American Frontier

John Petri built a life in Liberty Township that blended hard work and civic engagement. He cleared land, built a home, and worked in the logging industry. He also served as a Justice of the Peace and was appointed U.S. Postmaster, a remarkable achievement for an immigrant still mastering English.

In 1903, John married Gertrude Helbig, a young woman from Santa Fe, New Mexico, whose family had also emigrated from Germany. Their marriage was likely arranged as a “mail-order” match—Gertrude was 19 and John was 27. She traveled north to begin a new life in the forested wilds of Minnesota.

Together they had five children: Mathias, Robert, Fred, John Jr., and Marie. They farmed and logged to support their growing family. Tragically, in 1913, John was killed at age 38 by a falling tree in a logging accident. His widow Gertrude remained on the land and raised the children through difficult years. She later remarried Jack Erickson, and then later John’s brother Champy Petrie, and moved briefly to Milwaukee before returning to Liberty Township.

John’s youngest son, Robert, born November 16, 1904, would carry the family name forward—adding an “e” to become “Petrie,” a change believed to distance the name from its perceived Polish sound. Robert met Gladys Cooper at a dance in Minnesota and married in 1932, beginning a partnership shaped by hard work and frontier spirit. As a young couple, Robert operated a small logging camp, where his new bride, Gladys Cooper, served as the camp cook. 

In 1937, with three young sons—Milton, Vern, and Dale—they loaded their belongings into a small house mounted on the back of a truck. The family traveled west, living temporarily in Conrad, Montana, and Wallace, Idaho, where they operated a store. They ultimately settled in Spokane, Washington, where Robert worked as a carpenter and construction foreman and Gladys as a nurse.

The family made many return trips to Minnesota over the years. Robert remained active into his 90s, both passed away in 2002. The Petrie family’s westward journey—from Luxembourg to the Pacific Northwest—embodied resilience, reinvention, and a deep-rooted commitment to family.
