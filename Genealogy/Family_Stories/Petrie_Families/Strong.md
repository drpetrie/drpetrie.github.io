# The Strong Family

## Origins in America

The Strong family lineage stretches back to the earliest Puritan settlements in New England. One of their ancestors, Elder John Strong, immigrated to Massachusetts from England in the 1630s and became a foundational figure in early colonial life. Over generations, the Strongs moved westward—from Massachusetts to upstate New York and into Pennsylvania and the Midwest—seeking land and opportunity.

Walter Ezra Strong was born in 1855 in Farmersville, New York, and married Jennie Lydia Newman in 1874. In 1884, Walter led his extended family—including his mother, Priscilla (Crandall) Strong—on a bold move west to Spokane County, Washington. They traveled by train and settled on Wild Rose Prairie, where he purchased railroad land about twenty miles north of Spokane.

Walter was a farmer and a freight hauler who helped build the early infrastructure of the region. He was listed in regional directories as a farmer, and his industrious nature earned the respect of his community. He was a charter member of Lodge No. 7218 of the Modern Woodmen of America in Wayside, and also belonged to the Knights of the Maccabees. His wife Jennie was active in the Ladies of the Maccabees and a member of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Wild Rose.

Walter and Jennie had seven children: Dewitt F., Grace R., Mattie P., Willie H., Ethel M., Guy A., and Carl. Their descendants carried on the pioneering spirit of the family, contributing to the agricultural and social fabric of northeastern Washington.

Priscilla Crandall Strong, born in 1818 in New York, was herself a descendant of a prominent American family line. She lived with Walter’s family on Wild Rose Prairie until her death, remembered as a pioneer matriarch.

## Life on the American Frontier

Much of what we know about the Strong family's early years in Washington comes from the family history compiled by Jean Strong Siers. Her narrative highlights the daily lives and values passed down through generations. She recalled how the Strong home was filled with music, community gatherings, and hard work. Walter Ezra Strong, Jean’s great-grandfather, was remembered as a man of quiet strength who built not just a farm, but a lasting sense of place. Jean described how the family grew wheat and raised livestock on Wild Rose Prairie, with Jenny overseeing household operations and nurturing their children with firm but loving discipline. They were active in the Methodist church and participated in local lodge activities, building bonds with neighbors that would span generations. Jean’s account underscores how the Strongs rooted themselves in faith, diligence, and the belief that each generation should leave the land better than they found it.

William married Josephine Lillian Spence, a woman of English and Swedish descent born in Gridley, California. Josephine had a twin brother, James, and her early years were shaped by a rugged western lifestyle. Her father, John W. Spence, was a teamster who helped pioneer families move west. According to family accounts, he had such a good relationship with local Indigenous communities that they brought his family food during one of his long absences.

William and Josephine settled near Deer Park, Washington, where they raised their family on the rural plains. They instilled in their children a strong work ethic and respect for heritage. Their daughter, Thressa Lillian Strong, was born into this setting in 1915. She remembered her grandmother Jenny with great fondness and grew up helping with farm chores and caring for younger siblings.

Thressa married Herman Carl Daubel in 1937 after years of growing up in the same tight-knit rural community. Herman had worked for her father on the Strong family farm and was well known in the area for his quiet reliability and strong work ethic. Their marriage brought together two pioneering families of northeastern Washington—both grounded in agriculture, community service, and faith. They established their home on land cleared by Herman's family and continued the tradition of farming and self-sufficiency. Their union was marked by mutual respect, shared responsibilities, and deep devotion to family, raising six children and maintaining annual reunions that celebrated their strong family ties.
