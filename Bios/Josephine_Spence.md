# Josephine Lillian Spence (1889–1972)

## Early Life in California

Josephine Lillian Spence was born on December 27, 1889, in the fertile farming town of Gridley, nestled in California’s Sacramento Valley. She entered the world alongside her twin brother, James Joseph Spence, during a time of rapid agricultural expansion and opportunity in Butte County. Gridley was developing into a prominent farming community thanks to irrigation efforts and an expanding rail network that linked small valley towns to distant urban markets. Her early years were spent in a rural environment where farming and family went hand-in-hand, and her childhood was shaped by the values of hard work, cooperation, and faith that defined so many agrarian communities of that era.

## Family Background and Migration North

Her parents, John W. Spence and Sophia Margaret Anderson, were themselves immigrants or children of immigrants—John from England and Sophia from Sweden—who had settled in California during their westward journey. Like many families in the American West at the turn of the 20th century, the Spences were mobile and resilient, drawn ever forward by the promise of land and opportunity. By 1900, they had moved north to Fruitvale in Yakima County, Washington, a region being transformed by ambitious irrigation projects that converted the arid basin into a fertile agricultural haven. The Spence family's migration reflected the broader trend of American families seeking to homestead and build lasting communities in Washington’s vast, untapped landscapes.

## Marriage and Life on the Prairie

In her late teens, Josephine followed her family northward and settled in Wild Rose Prairie, just northwest of Spokane, Washington. The area was part of a patchwork of rural homesteads, with families scratching out a living through small-scale farming, logging, and work with the expanding rail lines. On September 9, 1908, Josephine married William “Bill” Henry Strong in Spokane. Their marriage represented the union of two frontier families, each shaped by migration, labor, and the challenges of taming the rugged inland Northwest.

The young couple moved to Denison, Washington, and eventually settled in Riverside, both small communities nestled among forests and valleys in Stevens County. Their early years together were marked by the physical demands of pioneer life: building shelter, maintaining livestock, planting crops, and raising children. With limited infrastructure and few modern conveniences, their homestead required constant attention and creativity. Nonetheless, Josephine and Bill built a stable home, rooted in mutual respect and shared responsibility.

## Raising a Family in Rural Washington

Josephine and Bill raised a large and close-knit family. She gave birth to nine children: Margaret, Kenneth, Thressa, Lyle, Walter, Milton, Ronald, Juanita, and a baby girl who died in infancy. Raising such a large family in rural northeastern Washington during the early to mid-20th century was an immense challenge, particularly during the harsh years of the Great Depression. Resources were scarce, and families depended on gardens, home-canned goods, hand-me-down clothing, and a strong network of neighbors to endure.

Josephine’s days were long and filled with labor—tending livestock, cooking large meals on a woodstove, teaching her children, and maintaining a household often without electricity or running water. Her children remembered her as firm but fair, a woman of quiet faith and immense strength. She taught her daughters to sew, her sons to work the land, and all of them the value of honesty and hard work. During hard winters, she made sure the family stayed warm and fed, often stretching meager provisions through cleverness and thrift.

## Later Years and Legacy

By 1940, the family had settled in Williams Valley, a rugged and sparsely populated region of Stevens County. Life there was rustic and isolated, but it offered open land, fresh air, and the self-reliant lifestyle the Strongs valued. The family operated a small farm and remained largely self-sufficient. Even as the outside world modernized, Josephine’s daily routines still resembled those of her pioneer forebears—hauling water, churning butter, tending chickens, and preserving food in root cellars.

Later in life, Josephine moved into Spokane, likely to be closer to medical care and her growing network of adult children and grandchildren. She remained close with her family, attending gatherings, helping raise grandchildren, and passing on stories of her youth and family history. Josephine passed away on August 7, 1972, in Deer Park, Washington, at the age of 82. Her death marked the end of an era, as she was one of the last living links to a generation that had crossed the continent and carved a life from the wilderness.

## A Legacy of Frontier Strength

Throughout her 82 years, Josephine embodied the frontier spirit—adaptable, hardworking, and rooted in family. She bridged eras, growing up in the final years of the 19th century and witnessing the dramatic transformations of the 20th. From the irrigated farmlands of California to the evergreen hills of northeastern Washington, her life tells a story of perseverance and devotion in a landscape as demanding as it was beautiful.

Her descendants remember her not only for her strength but also for her grace under pressure, her commitment to family, and her ability to find beauty in simple things. Her story, like so many women of her generation, is often told in quiet actions rather than headlines—but its impact endures. The values she lived by—honesty, faith, resilience, and care for others—remain a legacy that continues to shape generations of her family today.
