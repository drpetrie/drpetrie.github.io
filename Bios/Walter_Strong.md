# Walter Ezra Strong (1855–1921)

## Early Life in New York

Walter Ezra Strong was born on February 6, 1855, in the quiet farming township of Farmersville, nestled in the rolling hills of Cattaraugus County in western New York. He was the son of Ezra Brewster Strong Jr. and Priscilla B. Crandall, descendants of old New England stock with deep roots tracing back to colonial America. The Strong family name carried with it a legacy of religious devotion, hard work, and resilience—qualities that would define Walter’s life and the generations that followed. The Crandall family, through his mother Priscilla, was also a notable line in early American history, further enriching Walter’s legacy with deep ancestral roots.

The mid-19th century was a time of national upheaval and transformation, and Walter’s early years unfolded against the backdrop of the American Civil War and its aftermath. Farmersville, though rural and far removed from major battles, was not untouched by the war’s effects—men left for service, communities tightened bonds, and the nation’s ideals were reshaped. Walter grew up immersed in the rhythms of rural life: helping tend livestock, planting corn and oats, hauling water from nearby wells, and attending school during the off-season. Census records from 1855 through 1880 document his steady presence in the region, first in Farmersville and briefly in Machias, another small Cattaraugus County town. One gazetteer entry from the time identifies “Strong, Walter V., (Machlas,) r 10. farmer,” offering a glimpse of his role in the local agricultural economy.

By the time he reached adulthood, Walter had witnessed significant changes in American society and agriculture. The introduction of mechanical reapers, changing land use, and the shifting political climate likely influenced his growing interest in seeking better opportunities elsewhere.

## Marriage and Family

On July 3, 1875, Walter married Jeanette “Jennie” Lydia Newman, a union that would form the foundation of a close-knit and hardworking frontier family. Jennie, like Walter, hailed from a rural background and possessed the strength and determination necessary for life on the edge of America’s expanding frontier. Together, they would have seven children: Franklin Dewitt, Grace Ruby, Mattie Pearl, William “Bill” Henry, Ethel May, Guy Alfred, and Carl “Carlie” F. Strong.

Their early years as a couple were spent in New York, likely living near extended family, working small plots of land, and saving for the journey west. The children were raised in a household that valued discipline, thrift, and devotion to family—values that became essential as they prepared to leave behind their familiar homeland and venture into uncharted territory.

## Migration to Washington Territory

In 1884, Walter and Jennie made the ambitious decision to migrate westward to Washington Territory. Traveling by train, the entire Strong family—including Walter’s mother, Priscilla Crandall Strong—relocated to Wild Rose Prairie, about twenty miles north of Spokane. This was still a developing frontier landscape, but one ripe with opportunity.

According to regional historical accounts, Walter purchased a tract of railroad land on Wild Rose Prairie and immediately set to work building a home and establishing a farm. He constructed a log cabin, cleared fields, and began planting crops. Jennie managed the household and raised the children, their days governed by the cycles of planting and harvest, survival and celebration.

A biographical note in a Spokane history book described him as “one of the industrious, enterprising men of that community, esteemed and respected by all his neighbors.” His mother, Priscilla, herself a pioneer of 1884, was noted as continuing to live with the family well into her senior years, embodying the multigenerational strength of the household.

Over the ensuing decades, the family gradually relocated northward into Stevens County, settling in Riverside. Walter was recorded as a farmer in the 1900, 1910, and 1920 federal censuses, an occupation he maintained with pride and consistency. Though the land was often harsh, the community was resilient. Schools were built, churches were founded, and railroads brought new settlers and supplies.

## Occupation and Public Record

Walter’s name appeared in local directories and gazetteers, occasionally with minor transcription variations—such as “Walter V. Strong” of Machias. These brief notations underscored his public presence and contribution to the growing region. He worked primarily as a farmer but also participated in community life, including activities such as freighting, helping to move goods and supplies throughout the area.

His land likely produced wheat, oats, hay, and livestock—essential commodities for sustaining life and contributing to the local economy. His children worked beside him, learning the value of effort and the satisfaction of tangible results. That ethic would carry into the next generation, many of whom remained in the region and continued farming or related trades.

Walter was also a charter member of Lodge No. 7218 of the Modern Woodmen of America at Wayside and affiliated with the Knights of the Maccabees. Jennie was a member of the Ladies of the Maccabees and an active participant in the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Wild Rose, reflecting the family’s community involvement and religious faith.

## Later Years and Legacy

Walter Ezra Strong passed away on October 22, 1921, at his home in Wild Rose Prairie, Spokane County, at the age of 66. He was buried in Deer Park, a modest town that had grown alongside the railroads and represented the spirit of community on the edge of the wilderness.

By the time of his death, Walter had witnessed the transformation of the Washington Territory into a modern state. He had watched his children grow into adults, some raising their own families on land nearby. He had lived through war, migration, technological advancement, and the expansion of the American frontier.

His life stands as a testament to the pioneering spirit of his time—a bridge between the colonial roots of the Strong family in New England and the developing communities of the Pacific Northwest. Through diligence, sacrifice, and deep familial devotion, Walter helped lay the foundations for generations to come, transforming not only the land he worked but also the legacy he left behind.

In family memory, Walter was more than a name on a headstone—he was the patriarch whose quiet strength helped carry his family through one of the most dynamic periods in American history.
