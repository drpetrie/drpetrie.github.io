# Robert "Bob" Petrie

## A Pioneer Westward in a House on Wheels

### Early Life in Liberty Township

Born on November 16, 1904, in the rugged countryside of Liberty Township, Beltrami County, Minnesota, Robert “Bob” Petrie was the son of John and Gertrude (Helbig) Petrie—part of a hardworking frontier family of four sons and one daughter. Raised in the forests and farmland of northern Minnesota, Bob came of age amid the echoes of axes in logging camps and the rhythm of seasonal labor. His early years were marked by physical labor and community life, helping his parents and siblings navigate the harsh northern winters and the demands of homestead life. He attended local schools and gained an education not only in the classroom but in the woods and workshops where he learned the tools of survival.

In his youth, Bob worked in logging camps, developing skills in carpentry and construction that would serve him throughout his life. Logging in Minnesota’s vast pine forests required grit, stamina, and attention to safety. Bob honed these traits, gaining a reputation for his dependability and strength.

### Marriage and Early Family Life

In 1932, he met and married Gladys Cooper, a spirited and warmhearted young woman he had met at a dance. Their wedding celebration, held in the Deer Lake Community Club, was so lively it drew the largest crowd the hall had seen to that date. Together, they began a journey that would span decades, states, and countless stories.

The young couple settled into married life during the depths of the Great Depression. Between 1932 and 1937, they had three sons: Milton, Vern, and Dale. As times remained tough and opportunity beckoned in the West, Bob and Gladys—like so many Americans—set their sights on a new life beyond the horizon.

### Journey Westward

In 1937, encouraged by his brothers Alfred and Mathias and others who had already headed west, Bob made the bold decision to move his family from Bemidji, Minnesota, to the Pacific Northwest. He obtained a small 8x10 (possibly 12-foot) house from a neighbor, Oscar Richmond, and mounted it on the bed of his truck—effectively creating a homemade camper, years before the idea became common. A stove and a gas-powered washing machine were lashed to the back. With their three small boys packed inside, they began their slow, bumpy journey along the gravel roads that stretched across the Upper Midwest and Rockies.

They camped where they could, sometimes in river valleys, where Gladys would boil water on the wood stove to do laundry. One such wash day, surrounded by the mountains of Montana, became a cherished family story: clothes drying on bushes and branches under a clear sky, the sound of the rushing river, the family pausing to regroup before pressing westward again.

### Stops Along the Way

The Petries spent time in Conrad, Montana, where Bob took work to support them. The dry plains and small-town life offered new lessons in adaptation. They also stopped in Wallace, Idaho, for a time, where they ran a small store. The store, and later travels to California to visit family, added to their mosaic of experiences—bringing back sacks of walnuts, stories of distant relatives, and cherished family photos.

### Spokane: A New Beginning

They eventually settled in Spokane, Washington, reportedly after a snowstorm diverted them from a path toward Denver. Spokane became home. Bob found steady work and rose through the ranks of the construction trade, eventually becoming a foreman. He was known for his skill and work ethic and built a reputation as a solid and dependable man. Whether building homes, working on public projects, or mentoring younger tradesmen, Bob's craftsmanship and quiet leadership left a lasting impression.

Robert changed the spelling of “Petri” to “Petrie.” He reportedly added the 'e' because the name "Petri" sounded too Polish to his ear, and he preferred a version that felt more neutral. By adopting the spelling "Petrie," Robert signaled a desire to assimilate more easily into mainstream American culture—a decision echoed by many families of the time who modified names, speech, or customs to blend in.

### Family and Legacy

Robert and Gladys made Spokane their home for the rest of their lives. They maintained close ties with family back in Minnesota, making several road trips back east over the decades. Their travels became legendary in family lore. In 1996, at the age of 91, Bob and Gladys made one of their last great cross-country trips, driving from Spokane to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and then on to Minnesota.

Over the years, they became the central figures in an expanding family, hosting reunions, passing down heirlooms, and sharing stories from their youth. Bob enjoyed carpentry projects even in retirement. He and Gladys often visited the horse races, placed bets for fun, and enjoyed road trips to see relatives in California. They once bought two plots of land in New Mexico, which their descendants later inherited.

### Final Years

In their later years, Bob and Gladys were remembered as a lively and loving couple—always ready to reminisce, always full of stories. Bob suffered a stroke shortly after that final journey, which halted further travels, but his life had already become a testament to the spirit of movement, craftsmanship, and family devotion. His memory lives on in the houses he built, the stories he told, and the generations he helped set in motion.
