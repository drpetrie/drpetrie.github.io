A# nna Bartosh (1888-1964)

Anna Bartosh (later Cooper) was born on August 4, 1888, in Center Township, the daughter of Czech immigrants navigating the first generation of American life. Her father, Frank Bartosh, had been born in Neznašov, and, with his wife Mary Reha, belonged to the wave of Bohemian settlers who left the Austro-Hungarian Empire in search of land, stability, and independence in the rural Midwest.

## Childhood in an Immigrant World

Anna’s earliest years were spent in Iowa, but her upbringing was shaped by movement. Like many immigrant farm families, the Bartoshes relocated northward into South Dakota, likely settling in the Brown County or Hecla area where Czech communities formed strong ethnic and religious networks. Life revolved around farming, household labor, and church. From a young age, Anna would have shared in cooking, preserving food, tending gardens, and helping with fieldwork—work that left little room for sentimentality and demanded endurance.

## First Marriage and Early Motherhood

At about twenty-one, Anna married Jess Perry and became the mother of a son, William. The marriage ended in divorce, a difficult and uncommon outcome for a woman of her time, particularly within conservative immigrant communities. The decision reflects both personal hardship and quiet determination—traits often required of women whose lives did not conform to idealized frontier narratives.

## Marriage to Charles Cooper

On November 25, 1913, Anna married Charles Cooper, a widower with a young son, Edwin Cooper, from his first marriage to Bertha Clausen. Their marriage blended families and created a stable household forged more by necessity and responsibility than by ease. Charles formally adopted Anna’s son William, who thereafter was known as Bill Cooper, fully absorbed into the Cooper family.

Together, Anna and Charles raised five children, including Gladys Cooper, later Gladys Petrie, who would become a central link between earlier immigrant generations and the family’s later western chapters.

## Following Opportunity Across the Plains

Anna’s married life continued the pattern of mobility common to farming families in the early 20th century. The Coopers lived for a time in Cayuga, part of a broader migration driven by marginal farmland, fluctuating crop prices, and the pull of new opportunities. By the late 1920s, the family had moved into Minnesota, reflecting a widespread shift away from the harsher prairie frontier toward more established communities.

## Later Years and Character

Anna was remembered less for public accomplishments than for her steady presence. One family story captures her plainly spoken, practical nature. When a neighbor remarked of a newborn child, “He’s so young his eyes haven’t opened yet,” Anna replied without hesitation, “He’s sleeping, silly.” The moment reflects a woman grounded in experience, unimpressed by foolishness, and quietly confident in her understanding of life.

## Final Years and Death

Anna’s life ultimately carried her west again. She died on November 24, 1964, in Spokane, and was buried there. Her lifetime spanned immense change—from immigrant homesteads and horse-drawn farming to modern cities and multi-generational American families.

Anna Bartosh Cooper’s story is emblematic rather than exceptional. She bridged cultures, endured hardship, rebuilt family after loss, and helped anchor a lineage that no longer needed to chase land simply to survive. Through her children and grandchildren, the immigrant strength she inherited became something permanent.
