# William “Will” Henry Strong (1887–1967)

## Early Life on the Prairie

Born on February 4, 1887, in Spokane, Washington, William “Bill” Henry Strong came into the world during a time of transition in the American West. The frontier was giving way to more permanent settlements, and Spokane, though still modest in size, was beginning to flourish as a hub of commerce, agriculture, and rail transport. Bill was the son of Walter Ezra Strong and Jeanette “Jennie” Lydia Newman, members of a pioneering family that had migrated west from New York just a few years earlier. He grew up amid the sweeping wheat fields and pine-covered hills of Wild Rose Prairie—a rural expanse north of Spokane that offered rich soil, harsh winters, and a tight-knit community spirit.

The homestead lifestyle instilled in Bill a sense of independence, discipline, and resourcefulness from a young age. The prairie demanded long hours of work and a willingness to cooperate with neighbors to survive and thrive. Winters brought isolation and hard labor, while summers were filled with planting, tending livestock, and harvesting. These early experiences would leave a lasting imprint on Bill’s character and work ethic.

## Childhood in Stevens County

In the 1890s, Bill and his family relocated to Stevens County, Washington, a region defined by its early logging operations, burgeoning rail lines, and expanding agricultural economy. By the 1900 census, the Strongs were living in Clayton, a small but growing town in Stevens County. Clayton was known for its brickyards, mills, and access to the Great Northern Railway, which played a significant role in bringing commerce and people to the area. The town would have been bustling with activity from lumbermen, farmers, and merchants—offering young Bill a firsthand look at how frontier towns developed and sustained themselves.

As the son of a farmer and homesteader, Bill would have been expected to help with every aspect of rural life—splitting wood, hauling water, planting crops, and caring for animals. Schooling was often limited to the winter months when labor demands eased. Church and local community events were central to social life, and it’s likely that Bill grew up participating in neighborhood barn raisings, harvest festivals, and Sunday services.

## Marriage and Family Life

Around 1908, Bill returned to Wild Rose Prairie as a young man ready to begin a family of his own. On September 9, 1908, he married Josephine Lillian Spence in Spokane. Josephine came from another pioneer family, and their union symbolized the blending of two strong lineages with deep roots in the Inland Northwest. Together they raised a large and lively family of nine children: Margaret, Kenneth William, Thressa Lillian, Lyle Alfred, a baby girl who died in infancy, Walter Eugene, Milton Lorraine, Ronald Neile, and Juanita Ilene.

Raising a large family in rural Washington was no small feat. Josephine managed the household with unwavering dedication, while Bill provided through farming, logging, and other seasonal work. The children learned responsibility early—tending animals, collecting eggs, hauling firewood, and helping in the fields. Family life was grounded in faith, hard work, and a shared commitment to one another. The Strong home was likely filled with the sounds of piano music, mealtime stories, and the constant motion of farm life.

## A Life Rooted in Rural Washington

Throughout his adult life, Bill remained anchored in northeastern Washington. Census records trace the family's movements through several small farming communities: Denison in 1910, Riverside in the 1920s and 1930s, and Williams Valley by 1940. These communities were characterized by dirt roads, one-room schoolhouses, and general stores that served as gathering places for families scattered across the countryside. In these towns, Bill would have been known as a dependable neighbor and a skilled farmer.

Farming in those years required determination and adaptability. Bill likely grew staple crops like wheat, oats, and potatoes while maintaining livestock for milk, eggs, and meat. When not farming, he may have supplemented the family income with logging, sawmill work, or seasonal labor. Life was not easy—weather could ruin crops, and illness or injury posed constant threats—but the Strongs persevered through sheer grit and community support.

## Later Years and Legacy

By 1950, Bill was living once again in Stevens County as head of a household that continued to evolve as his children grew and left home. He remained active in the daily life of the farm well into his senior years, passing on knowledge and values to younger family members. His later years were spent in Deer Park, a small but thriving town north of Spokane. Known for its community fairs, lumberyards, and warm local traditions, Deer Park became the final chapter of Bill’s long and industrious life.

Bill passed away in Deer Park on September 6, 1967, at the age of 80. He left behind a wide network of children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren who carried on the legacy of hard work and dedication he embodied. His life spanned an era of immense transformation—from horse-drawn wagons and lantern-lit homesteads to paved highways, tractors, and electric lights. Through all those changes, he remained a man of the land, grounded in tradition, family, and the enduring values of frontier life.

To this day, William “Bill” Henry Strong is remembered with pride by his descendants, many of whom still live in the Inland Northwest. His legacy lives not just in memory, but in the stories, fields, and families he helped cultivate.
